</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>20:2 And he said to him, Far be the thought: you will not be put to death: see, my father does nothing, great or small, without giving me word of it: would he keep this secret from me? It is not so.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:2 约拿单回答说，断然不是。你必不至死。我父作事，无论大小，没有不叫我知道的。怎么独有这事隐瞒我呢？决不如此。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>20:3 But David took his oath again and said, Your father sees that I am dear to you; so he says to himself, Let Jonathan have no idea of this, for it will be a grief to him; but as the Lord is living, and as your soul is living, there is only a step between me and death.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:3 大卫又起誓说，你父亲准知我在你眼前蒙恩。他心里说，不如不叫约拿单知道，恐怕他愁烦。我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我离死不过一步。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>20:4 Then Jonathan said to David, Whatever your desire is, I will do it for you.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>20:5 And David said to Jonathan, Tomorrow is the new moon, and I will not be seated with the king at his table: but let me go to a safe place in the country till the evening.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:5 大卫对约拿单说，明日是初一，我当与王同席，求你容我去藏在田野，直到第三日晚上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>20:6 And if your father takes note of the fact that I am away, say, David made a request to me for himself that he might go to Beth-lehem, to his town: for it is the time when his family make their offering year by year.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:6 你父亲若见我不在席上，你就说，大卫切求我许他回本城伯利恒去，因为他全家在那里献年祭。

</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:8 求你施恩与仆人，因你在耶和华面前曾与仆人结盟。我若有罪，不如你自己杀我，何必将我交给你父亲呢？

</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:13 我父亲若有意害你，我不告诉你使你平平安安地走，愿耶和华重重地降罚与我。愿耶和华与你同在，如同从前与我父亲同在一样。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>20:27 And on the day after the new moon, that is, the second day, there was still no one in David's seat: and Saul said to his son Jonathan, Why has the son of Jesse not come to the feast yesterday or today?
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:27 初二日大卫的座位还空设。扫罗问他儿子约拿单说，耶西的儿子为何昨日，今日没有来吃饭呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>20:28 And answering Saul, Jonathan said, He made a request to me that he might go to Beth-lehem,

</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:29 他说，求你容我去，因为我家在城里有献祭的事。我长兄吩咐我去。如今我若在你眼前蒙恩，求你容我去见我的弟兄。所以大卫没有赴王的席。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>20:30 Then Saul was moved to wrath against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of an evil and uncontrolled woman, have I not seen how you have given your love to the son of Jesse, to your shame and the shame of your mother?
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:30 扫罗向约拿单发怒，对他说，你这顽梗背逆之妇人所生的，我岂不知道你喜悦耶西的儿子，自取羞辱，以至你母亲露体蒙羞吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>20:31 For while the son of Jesse is living on the earth, your position is unsafe and your kingdom is in danger. So make him come here to me, for it is certainly right for him to be put to death.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:31 耶西的儿子若在世间活着，你和你的国位必站立不住。现在你要打发人去，将他捉拿交给我。他是该死的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>20:32 And Jonathan, answering his father Saul, said to him, Why is he to be put to death? What has he done?
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:32 约拿单对父亲扫罗说，他为什么该死呢？他作了什么呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>20:33 And Saul, pointing his spear at him, made an attempt to give him a wound: from which it was clear to Jonathan that his father's purpose was to put David to death.
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:33 扫罗向约拿单抡枪要刺他，约拿单就知道他父亲决意要杀大卫。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>20:34 So Jonathan got up from the table, burning with wrath, and took no part in the feast the second day of the month, being full of grief for David because his father had put shame on him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:34 于是约拿单气忿忿地从席上起来，在这初二日没有吃饭。他因见父亲羞辱大卫，就为大卫愁烦。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"> <p>20:35 Now in the morning, Jonathan went out into the fields at the time he had said to David, and he had a little boy with him.

</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:38 约拿单又呼叫童子说，速速地去，不要迟延。童子就拾起箭来，回到主人那里。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_38');"> <p>20:39 But the boy had no idea what was going on; only Jonathan and David had knowledge of it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_38" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:39 童子却不知道这是什么意思，只有约拿单和大卫知道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"> <p>20:40 And Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy, and said to him, Take these and go back to the town.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_40');"> <p>20:41 And when the boy had gone, David came from his secret place by the hill, and falling to the earth went down on his face three times: and they gave one another a kiss, weeping together, till David's grief was the greater.
</p></origin><translate id="div_40" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:41 童子一去，大卫就从磐石的南边出来，俯伏在地，拜了三拜。二人亲嘴，彼此哭泣，大卫哭得更恸。
