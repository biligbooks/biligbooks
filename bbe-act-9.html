</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>9:22 But Saul went on increasing in power, and the Jews in Damascus were not able to give answers to the arguments by which he made it clear that Jesus was the Christ.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:22 但扫罗越发有能力，驳倒住大马色的犹太人，证明耶稣是基督。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>9:23 Then, after some days, the Jews made an agreement together to put him to death:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>9:26 And when he came to Jerusalem, he made an attempt to be joined to the disciples, but they were all in fear of him, not taking him for a disciple.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:26 扫罗到了耶路撒冷，想与门徒结交。他们却都怕他，不信他是门徒。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>9:27 But Barnabas took him to the Apostles and gave them an account of how he had seen the Lord on the road, and had given hearing to his words, and how at Damascus he had been preaching in the name of Jesus without fear.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:27 惟有巴拿巴接待他，领去见使徒，把他在路上怎么看见主，主怎么向他说话，他在大马色，怎么奉耶稣的名放胆传道，都述说出来。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>9:30 And when the brothers had knowledge of it, they took him to Caesarea and sent him to Tarsus.
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:30 弟兄们知道了，就送他下该撒利亚，打发他往大数去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>9:31 And so the church through all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was made strong; and, living in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, was increased greatly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:31 那时犹太，加利利，撒玛利亚，各处的教会都得平安，被建立。凡事敬畏主，蒙圣灵的安慰，人数就增多了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>9:32 And it came about that while Peter was going through all parts of the country he came to the saints who were living at Lydda.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>9:36 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, that is, Dorcas: this woman was given to good works and acts of mercy at all times.
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:36 在约帕有一个女徒，名叫大比大，翻希利尼话，就是多加。（多加就是羚羊的意思）她广行善事，多施周济。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"> <p>9:37 And it came about, in those days, that she got ill and came to her death: and when she had been washed, they put her in a room which was high up.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_37');"> <p>9:38 And because Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having knowledge that Peter was there, sent two men to him, requesting him to come to them straight away.
</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:38 吕大原与约帕相近。门徒听见彼得在那里，就打发两个人去见他，央求他说，快到我们那里去，不要耽延。

</p></origin><translate id="div_38" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:39 彼得就起身和他们同去。到了，便有人领他上楼。众寡妇都站在彼得旁边哭，拿多加与她们同在时，所做的里衣外衣给他看。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"> <p>9:40 But Peter made them all go outside, and went down on his knees in prayer; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, get up. And, opening her eyes, she saw Peter and got up.
</p></origin><translate id="div_39" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:40 彼得叫她们都出去，就跪下祷告，转身对着死人说，大比大，起来，她就睁开眼睛，见了彼得，便坐起来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_40');"> <p>9:41 And he took her hand, lifting her up; and, sending for the saints and widows, he gave her to them, living.
