</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>8:7 For unclean spirits came out from those who had them, crying with a loud voice; and a number of those who were ill and broken in body were made well.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:7 因为有许多人被污鬼附着，那些鬼大声呼叫，从他们身上出来。还有许多瘫痪的，瘸腿的，都得了医治。

</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:8 在那城里，就大有欢喜。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>8:9 But there was a certain man named Simon, who in the past had been a wonder-worker and a cause of surprise to the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was a great man:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>8:11 And they gave attention to him, because for a long time his wonder-working powers had kept them under his control.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:11 他们听从他，因他久用邪术，使他们惊奇。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>8:12 But when they had faith in the good news given by Philip about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, a number of men and women had baptism.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:12 及至他们信了腓利所传神国的福音，和耶稣基督的名，连男带女就受了洗。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>8:13 And Simon himself had faith and, having had baptism, he went with Philip and, seeing the signs and the great wonders which he did, he was full of surprise.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:13 西门自己也信了。既受了洗，就常与腓利在一处。看见他所行的神迹和大异能，就甚惊奇。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>8:14 Now when the Apostles at Jerusalem had news that the people of Samaria had taken the word of God into their hearts, they sent to them Peter and John;
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:14 使徒在耶路撒冷，听见撒玛利亚人领受了神的道，就打发彼得约翰往他们那里去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>8:15 Who, when they came there, made prayer for them, that the Holy Spirit might be given to them:
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:15 两个人到了，就为他们祷告，要叫他们受圣灵。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>8:16 For up to that time he had not come on any of them; only baptism had been given to them in the name of the Lord Jesus.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:16 因为圣灵还没有降在他们一个人身上。他们只奉主耶稣的名受了洗。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>8:17 Then they put their hands on them, and the Holy Spirit came on them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:17 于是使徒按手在他们头上，他们就受了圣灵。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>8:18 Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the touch of the Apostles' hands, he made them an offering of money, saying,
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:18 西门看见使徒按手，便有圣灵赐下。就拿钱给使徒，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>8:19 Give me this power, so that when I put my hands on anyone he may get the Holy Spirit.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:19 说，把这权柄也给我，叫我手按着谁。谁就可以受圣灵。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>8:20 But Peter said, May your money come to destruction with you, because you had the idea that what is freely given by God may be got for a price.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:20 彼得说，你的银子，和你一同灭亡吧。因你想神的恩赐，是可以用钱买的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>8:21 You have no part in this business, because your heart is not right before God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:21 你在这道上，无分无关。因为在神面前，你的心不正。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>8:22 Let your heart be changed, and make prayer to God that you may have forgiveness for your evil thoughts.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:22 你当懊悔你这罪恶，祈求主。或者你心里的意念可得赦免。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>8:23 For I see that you are prisoned in bitter envy and the chains of sin.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:23 我看出你正在苦胆之中，被罪恶捆绑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>8:24 And Simon, answering, said, Make prayer for me to the Lord, so that these things which you have said may not come on me.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:24 西门说，愿你们为我求主，叫你们所说的，没有一样临到我身上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>8:25 So they, having given their witness and made clear the word of the Lord, went back to Jerusalem, giving the good news on their way in a number of the small towns of Samaria.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:25 使徒既证明主道，而且传讲，就回耶路撒冷去，一路在撒玛利亚好些村庄传扬福音。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>8:26 But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, Get up, and go to the south, to the road which goes from Jerusalem to Gaza, through the waste land.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:26 有主的一个使者对腓利说，起来，向南走，往那从耶路撒冷下迦萨的路上去。那路是旷野。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>8:27 And he went and there was a man of Ethiopia, a servant of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, and controller of all her property, who had come up to Jerusalem for worship;
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:27 腓利就起身去了。不料，有一个埃提阿伯（即古实，见以赛亚十八章一节）人，是个有大权的太监，在埃提阿伯女王干大基的手下总管银库，他上耶路撒冷礼拜去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>8:28 He was going back, seated in his carriage, and was reading the book of the prophet Isaiah.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:28 现在回来，在车上坐着，念先知以赛亚的书。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>8:29 And the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and get on his carriage.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:29 圣灵对腓利说，你去贴近那车走。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>8:30 And Philip, running up to him, saw that he was reading Isaiah the prophet, and said to him, Is the sense of what you are reading clear to you?
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:30 腓利就跑到太监那里，听见他念先知以赛亚的书，便问他说，你所念的，你明白吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>8:31 And he said, How is that possible when I have no guide? And he made Philip get up by his side.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:31 他说，没有人指教我，怎能明白呢？于是请腓利上车，与他同坐。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>8:32 Now the place in the book where he was reading was this: He was taken, like a sheep, to be put to death; and as a lamb is quiet when its wool is being cut, so he made no sound:
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:32 他所念的那段经，说，他像羊被牵到宰杀之地，又像羊羔在剪毛的人手下无声，他也是这样不开口。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>8:33 Being of low degree, his cause was not given a hearing: who has knowledge of his family? for his life is cut off from the earth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:33 他卑微的时候，人不按公义审判他。（原文作他的审判被夺去）谁能述说他的世代，因为他的生命从地上夺去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>8:34 And the Ethiopian said to Philip, About whom are these words said by the prophet? about himself, or some other?
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:34 太监对腓利说，请问先知说这话，是指着谁，是指着自己呢？是指着别人呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"> <p>8:35 So Philip, starting from this writing, gave him the good news about Jesus.
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:35 腓利就开口从这经上起，对他传讲耶稣
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>8:36 And while they were going on their way, they came to some water, and the Ethiopian said, See, here is water; why may I not have baptism?
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:36 二人正往前走，到了有水的地方，太监说，看哪，这里有水，我受洗有什么妨碍呢？（有古卷在此有
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"> <p>8:37 []
</p></origin><translate id="div_36" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:37 腓利说，你若是一心相信就可以，他回答说，我信耶稣基督是神的儿子）
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_37');"> <p>8:38 And he gave orders for the carriage to be stopped, and the two of them went down into the water, and Philip gave him baptism.
</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:38 于是吩咐车站住，腓利和太监二人同下水里去，腓利就给他施洗。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_38');"> <p>8:39 And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away; and the Ethiopian saw him no more, for he went on his way full of joy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_38" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:39 从水里上来，主的灵把腓利提了去，太监也不再见他了，就欢欢喜喜地走路。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"> <p>8:40 But Philip came to Azotus, and went through all the towns, preaching the good news, till he came to Caesarea.
</p></origin><translate id="div_39" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:40 后来有人在亚锁都遇见腓利，他走遍那地方，在各城宣传福音，直到该撒利亚。
