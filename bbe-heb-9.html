<origin onclick="showDiv('div_0');"> <p>9:1 Now the first agreement had its rules of worship, and a holy order.
</p></origin><translate id="div_0" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:1 原来前约有礼拜的条例，和属世界的圣幕。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>9:2 For the first Tent was made ready, having in it the vessels for the lights and the table and the ordering of the bread; and this is named the holy place.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:2 因为有预备的帐幕，头一层叫作圣所。里面有灯台，桌子，和陈设饼。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>9:3 And inside the second veil was the place which is named the Holy of holies;
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:3 第二幔子后，又有一层帐幕，叫作至圣所。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>9:4 Having a vessel of gold in it for burning perfumes, and the ark of the agreement, which was covered with gold and which had in it a pot made of gold for the manna, and Aaron's rod which put out buds, and the stones with the writing of the agreement;
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:4 有金香炉，（炉或作坛）有包金的约柜，柜里有盛吗哪的金罐，和亚伦发过芽的杖，并两块约版。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>9:5 And over it were the winged ones of glory with their wings covering the mercy-seat; about which it is not possible now to say anything in detail.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:5 柜上面有荣耀基路伯的影罩着施恩座。（施恩原文作蔽罪）这几件我现在不能一一细说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>9:6 Now while these things were in existence, the priests went into the first Tent at all times, for prayer and the making of offerings.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:6 这些物件既如此预备齐了，众祭司就常进头一层帐幕，行拜神的礼。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>9:7 But only the high priest went into the second, once a year, not without making an offering of blood for himself and for the errors of the people:
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:7 至于第二层帐幕，惟有大祭司一年一次独自进去，没有不带着血，为自己和百姓的过错献上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>9:8 The Holy Spirit witnessing by this that the way into the holy place had not at that time been made open, while the first Tent was still in being;
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:8 圣灵用此指明，头一层帐幕仍存的时候，进入至圣所的路还未显明。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>9:9 And this is an image of the present time; when the offerings which are given are not able to make the heart of the worshipper completely clean,
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:9 那头一层帐幕作现今的一个表样，所献的礼物和祭物，就着良心说，都不能叫礼拜的人得以完全。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>9:10 Because they are only rules of the flesh, of meats and drinks and washings, which have their place till the time comes when things will be put right.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:10 这些事连那饮食和诸般洗濯的规矩，都不过是属肉体的条例，命定到振兴的时候为止。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>9:11 But now Christ has come as the high priest of the good things of the future, through this greater and better Tent, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this world,
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:11 但现在基督已经来到，作了将来美事的大祭司，经过那更大更全备的帐幕，不是人手所造也不是属乎这世界的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>9:12 And has gone once and for ever into the holy place, having got eternal salvation, not through the blood of goats and young oxen, but through his blood.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:12 并且不用山羊和牛犊的血，乃用自己的血，只一次进入圣所，成了永远赎罪的事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>9:13 For if the blood of goats and oxen, and the dust from the burning of a young cow, being put on the unclean, make the flesh clean:
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:13 若山羊和公牛的血，并母牛犊的灰洒在不洁的人身上，尚且叫人成圣，身体洁净。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>9:14 How much more will the blood of Christ, who, being without sin, made an offering of himself to God through the Holy Spirit, make your hearts clean from dead works to be servants of the living God?
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:14 何况基督借着永远的灵，将自己无瑕无疵献给神，他的血岂不更能洗净你们的心。（原文作良心）除去你们的死行，使你们事奉那永生神吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>9:15 And for this cause it is through him that a new agreement has come into being, so that after the errors under the first agreement had been taken away by his death, the word of God might have effect for those who were marked out for an eternal heritage.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:15 为此他作了新约的中保。既然受死赎了人在前约之时所犯的罪过，便叫蒙召之人得着所应许永远的产业。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>9:16 Because where there is a testament, there has to be the death of the man who made it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:16 凡有遗命，必须等到留遗命的人死了。（遗命原文与约字同）
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>9:17 For a testament has effect after death; for what power has it while the man who made it is living?
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:17 因为人死了，遗命才有效力，若留遗命的尚在，那遗命还有用处吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>9:18 So that even the first agreement was not made without blood.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:18 所以前约也不是不用血立的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>9:19 For when Moses had given all the rules of the law to the people, he took the blood of goats and young oxen, with water and red wool and hyssop, and put it on the book itself and on all the people,
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:19 因为摩西当日照着律法，将各样诫命传给众百姓，就拿朱红色绒和牛膝草，把牛犊山羊的血和水，洒在书上，又洒在众百姓身上，说，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>9:20 Saying, This blood is the sign of the agreement which God has made with you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:20 这血就是神与你们立约的凭据。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>9:21 And the blood was put on the Tent and all the holy vessels in the same way.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:21 他又照样把血洒在帐幕，和各样器皿上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>9:22 And by the law almost all things are made clean with blood, and without blood there is no forgiveness.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:22 按着律法，凡物差不多都是用血洁净的，若不流血，罪就不得赦免了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>9:23 For this cause it was necessary to make the copies of the things in heaven clean with these offerings; but the things themselves are made clean with better offerings than these.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:23 照着天上样式作的物件，必须用这些祭物去洁净。但那天上的本物，自然当用更美的祭物去洁净。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>9:24 For Christ did not go into a holy place which had been made by men's hands as the copy of the true one; but he went into heaven itself, and now takes his place before the face of God for us.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:24 因为基督并不是进了人手所造的圣所，（这不过是真圣所的影像）乃是进了天堂，如今为我们显在神面前。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>9:25 And he did not have to make an offering of himself again and again, as the high priest goes into the holy place every year with blood which is not his;
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:25 也不是多次将自己献上，像那大祭司每年带着牛羊的血进入圣所（牛羊的血原文作不是自己的血）。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>9:26 For then he would have undergone a number of deaths from the time of the making of the world: but now he has come to us at the end of the old order, to put away sin by the offering of himself.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:26 如果这样，他从创世以来，就必多次受苦了。但如今在这末世显现一次，把自己献为祭，好除掉罪。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>9:27 And because by God's law death comes to men once, and after that they are judged;
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:27 按着定命，人人都有一死，死后且有审判。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>9:28 So Christ, having at his first coming taken on himself the sins of men, will be seen a second time, without sin, by those who are waiting for him, for their salvation.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:28 象这样，基督既然一次被献，担当了多人的罪，将来要向那等候他的人第二次显现，并与罪无关，乃是为拯救他们。
