</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:4 门徒回答说，在这野地，从哪里能得饼，叫这些人吃饱呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>8:5 And he put the question, How much bread have you? And they said, Seven cakes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:5 耶稣问他们说，你们有多少饼？他们说，七个。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>8:12 And he was very sad in spirit, and said, Why is this generation looking for a sign? truly, I say to you, No sign will be given to this generation.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:12 耶稣心里深深地叹息说，这世代为什么求神迹呢？我实在告诉你们，没有神迹给这世代看。

</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:16 他们彼此议论说，这是因为我们没有饼吧。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>8:17 And Jesus, hearing it, said to them, Why are you reasoning among yourselves because you have no bread? do you still not see, and is it still not clear to you? are your hearts so hard?
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:17 耶稣看出来，就说，你们为什么因为没有饼就议论呢？你们还不省悟，还不明白吗？你们的心还是愚顽吗？

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>8:25 Then again he put his hands on his eyes; and looking hard, he was able to see, and saw all things clearly.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:25 随后又按手在他眼睛上，他定睛一看，就复了原，样样都看得清楚了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>8:26 And he sent him away to his house, saying, Do not even go into the town.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:26 耶稣打发他回家，说，连这村子你也不要进去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>8:27 And Jesus went out, with his disciples, into the little towns round Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he put a question to his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I am?
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:27 耶稣和门徒出去，往该撒利亚腓立比的村庄去。在路上问门徒说，人说我是谁。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>8:28 And they made answer, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:28 他们说，有人说，是施洗的约翰。有人说，是以利亚。又有人说，是先知里的一位。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>8:29 And he said to them, But who do you say I am? Peter said in answer, You are the Christ.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:29 又问他们说，你们说我是谁。彼得回答说，你是基督。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>8:30 And he put them under orders not to say this of him to anyone.
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:30 耶稣就禁戒他们，不要告诉人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>8:31 And teaching them, he said that the Son of man would have to undergo much, and be hated by those in authority, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be put to death, and after three days come back from the dead.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:31 从此他教训他们说，人子必须受许多的苦，被长老祭司长和文士弃绝，并且被杀，过三天复活。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>8:32 And he said this openly. And Peter took him, and was protesting.
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:32 耶稣明明地说这话，彼得就拉着他，劝他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>8:33 But he, turning about, and seeing his disciples, said sharply to Peter, Get out of my way, Satan: for your mind is not on the things of God, but on the things of men.
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:33 耶稣转过来，看着门徒，就责备彼得说，撒但，退我后边去吧。因为你不体贴神的意思，只体贴人的意思。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>8:34 And turning to the mass of people with his disciples, he said to them, If any man has the desire to come after me, let him give up all other desires, and take up his cross and come after me.
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:34 于是叫众人和门徒来，对他们说，若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，背起他的十字架来跟从我。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"> <p>8:35 Whoever has a desire to keep his life, will have it taken from him; and whoever gives up his life because of me and the good news, will keep it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:35 因为凡要救自己生命的，（生命或作灵魂下同）必丧掉生命。凡为我和福音丧掉生命的，必救了生命。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>8:36 What profit has a man if he gets all the world with the loss of his life?
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:36 人就是赚得全世界，赔上自己的生命，有什么益处呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"> <p>8:37 And what would a man give in exchange for his life?
</p></origin><translate id="div_36" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:37 人还能拿什么换生命呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_37');"> <p>8:38 Whoever has a feeling of shame because of me and my words in this false and evil generation, the Son of man will have a feeling of shame because of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:38 凡在这淫乱罪恶的世代，把我和我的道当作可耻的，人子在他父的荣耀里，同圣天使降临的时候，也要把那人当作可耻的。
