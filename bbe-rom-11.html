</p></origin><translate id="div_0" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:1 我且说，神弃绝了他的百姓吗？断乎没有。因为我也是以色列人，亚伯拉罕的后裔，属便雅悯支派的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>11:2 God has not put away the people of his selection. Or have you no knowledge of what is said about Elijah in the holy Writings? how he says words to God against Israel,
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:2 神并没有弃绝他预先所知道的百姓。你们岂不晓得经上论到以利亚是怎么说的呢？他在神面前怎样控告以色列人，说，

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>11:4 But what answer does God make to him? I have still seven thousand men whose knees have not been bent to Baal.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:4 神的回话是怎么说的呢？他说，我为自己留下七千人，是未曾向巴力屈膝的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>11:5 In the same way, there are at this present time some who are marked out by the selection of grace.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:5 如今也是这样，照着拣选的恩典还有所留的余数。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>11:6 But if it is of grace, then it is no longer of works: or grace would not be grace.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:6 既是出于恩典，就不在乎行为。不然，恩典就不是恩典了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>11:7 What then? That which Israel was searching for he did not get, but those of the selection got it and the rest were made hard.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:7 这是怎么样呢？以色列人所求的，他们没有得着。惟有蒙拣选的人得着了，其余的就成了顽梗不化的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>11:8 As it was said in the holy Writings, God gave them a spirit of sleep, eyes which might not see, and ears which have no hearing, to this day.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:8 如经上所记，神给他们昏迷的心，眼睛不能看见，耳朵不能听见，直到今日。

</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:9 大卫也说，愿他们的筵席变为网罗，变为机槛，变为绊脚石，作他们的报应。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>11:10 Let their eyes be made dark so that they may not see, and let their back be bent down at all times.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:10 愿他们的眼睛昏蒙，不得看见。愿你时常弯下他们的腰。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>11:11 So I say, Were their steps made hard in order that they might have a fall? In no way: but by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, so that they might be moved to envy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:11 我且说，他们失脚是要他们跌倒吗？断乎不是。反倒因他们的过失，救恩便临到外邦人，要激动他们发愤。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>11:12 Now, if their fall is the wealth of the world, and their loss the wealth of the Gentiles, how much greater will be the glory when they are made full?
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:12 若他们的过失，为天下的富足，他们的缺乏，为外邦人的富足。何况他们的丰满呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>11:13 But I say to you, Gentiles, in so far as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles, I make much of my position:
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:13 我对你们外邦人说这话。因我是外邦人的使徒，所以敬重我的职分。（敬重原文作荣耀）
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>11:14 If in any way those who are of my flesh may be moved to envy, so that some of them may get salvation by me.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>11:15 For, if by their putting away, the rest of men have been made friends with God, what will their coming back again be, but life from the dead?
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:15 若他们被丢弃，天下就得与神和好，他们被收纳，岂不是死而复生吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>11:16 And if the first-fruit is holy, so is the mass: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:16 所献的新面，若是圣洁，全团也就圣洁了。树根若是圣洁，树枝也就圣洁了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>11:17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, an olive-tree of the fields, were put in among them, and were given a part with them in the root by which the olive-tree is made fertile,

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>11:18 Do not be uplifted in pride over the branches: because it is not you who are the support of the root, but it is by the root that you are supported.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:18 你就不可向旧枝子夸口，若是夸口，当知道不是你托着根，乃是根托着你。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>11:19 You will say, Branches were broken off so that I might be put in.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:19 你若说，那枝子被折下来，是特为叫我接上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>11:20 Truly, because they had no faith they were broken off, and you have your place by reason of your faith. Do not be lifted up in pride, but have fear;
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:20 不错。他们因为不信，所以被折下来。你因为信，所以立得住。你不可自高，反要惧怕。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>11:21 For, if God did not have mercy on the natural branches, he will not have mercy on you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:21 神既不爱惜原来的枝子，也必不爱惜你。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>11:22 See then that God is good but his rules are fixed: to those who were put away he was hard, but to you he has been good, on the condition that you keep in his mercy; if not, you will be cut off as they were.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:22 可见神的恩慈，和严厉。向那跌倒的人，是严厉的。向你是有恩慈的，只要你长久在他的恩慈里。不然，你也要被砍下来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>11:23 And they, if they do not go on without faith, will be united to the tree again, because God is able to put them in again.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:23 而且他们若不是长久不信，仍要被接上。因为神能够把他们从新接上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>11:24 For if you were cut out of a field olive-tree, and against the natural use were united to a good olive-tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be united again with the olive-tree which was theirs?
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:24 你是从那天生的野橄榄上砍下来的，尚且逆着性得接在好橄榄上，何况这本树的枝子，要接在本树上呢。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>11:25 For it is my desire, brothers, that this secret may be clear to you, so that you may not have pride in your knowledge, that Israel has been made hard in part, till all the Gentiles have come in;
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:25 弟兄们，我不愿意你们不知道这奥秘，（恐怕你们自以为聪明）就是以色列人有几分是硬心的，等到外邦人的数目添满了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>11:26 And so all Israel will get salvation: as it is said in the holy Writings, There will come out of Zion the One who makes free; by him wrongdoing will be taken away from Jacob:
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:26 于是以色列全家都要得救，如经上所记，必有一位救主，从锡安出来，要消除雅各家的一切罪恶。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>11:27 And this is my agreement with them, when I will take away their sins.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:27 又说，我除去他们罪的时候，这就是我与他们所立的约。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>11:28 As far as the good news is in question, they are cut off from God on account of you, but as far as the selection is in question, they are loved on account of the fathers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:28 就着福音说，他们为你们的缘故是仇敌。就着拣选说，他们为列祖的缘故是蒙爱的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>11:29 Because God's selection and his mercies may not be changed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:29 因为神的恩赐和选召，是没有后悔的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>11:30 For as you, in time past, were not under the rule of God, but now have got mercy through their turning away,
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:30 你们从前不顺服神，如今因他们的不顺服，你们倒蒙了怜恤。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>11:31 So in the same way these have gone against the orders of God, so that by the mercy given to you they may now get mercy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:31 这样，他们也是不顺服，叫他们因着施给你们的怜恤，现在也就蒙怜恤。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>11:32 For God has let them all go against his orders, so that he might have mercy on them all.
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:32 因为神将众人都圈在不顺服之中，特意要怜恤众人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>11:33 O how deep is the wealth of the wisdom and knowledge of God! no one is able to make discovery of his decisions, and his ways may not be searched out.
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:33 深哉，神丰富的智慧和知识。他的判断，何其难测，他的踪迹，何其难寻，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>11:34 Who has knowledge of the mind of the Lord? or who has taken part in his purposes?
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:34 谁知道主的心？谁作过他的谋士呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"> <p>11:35 Or who has first given to him, and it will be given back to him again?
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:35 谁是先给了他，使他后来偿还呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>11:36 For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever. So be it.
