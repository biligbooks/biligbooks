</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>19:36 Your servant's desire was only to take the king over Jordan; why is the king to give me such a reward?
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:36 仆人只要送王过约旦河，王何必赐我这样的恩典呢？

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_38');"> <p>19:39 Then all the people went over Jordan, and the king went over: and the king gave Barzillai a kiss, with his blessing; and he went back to his place.
</p></origin><translate id="div_38" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:39 于是众民过约旦河，王也过去。王与巴西莱亲嘴，为他祝福，巴西莱就回本地去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"> <p>19:40 So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went with him: and all the people of Judah, as well as half the people of Israel, took the king on his way.
</p></origin><translate id="div_39" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:40 王过去，到了吉甲，金罕也跟他过去。犹大众民和以色列民的一半也都送王过去。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_41');"> <p>19:42 And all the men of Judah gave this answer to the men of Israel, Because the king is our near relation: why then are you angry about this? have we taken any of the king's food, or has he given us any offering?
</p></origin><translate id="div_41" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:42 犹大众人回答以色列人说，因为王与我们是亲属，你们为何因这事发怒呢？我们吃了王的什么呢？王赏赐了我们什么呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_42');"> <p>19:43 And in answer to the men of Judah, the men of Israel said, We have ten parts in the king, and we are the first in order of birth: why did you make nothing of us? and were we not the first to make suggestions for getting the king back? And the words of the men of Judah were more violent than the words of the men of Israel.
</p></origin><translate id="div_42" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:43 以色列人回答犹大人说，按支派，我们与王有十分的情分。在大卫身上，我们也比你们更有情分。你们为何藐视我们，请王回来不先与我们商量呢？但犹大人的话比以色列人的话更硬。
