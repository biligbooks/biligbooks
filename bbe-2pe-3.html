<origin onclick="showDiv('div_0');"> <p>3:1 My loved ones, this is now my second letter to you, and in this as in the first, I am attempting to keep your true minds awake;
</p></origin><translate id="div_0" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:1 亲爱的弟兄啊，我现在写给你们的是第二封信。这两封都是提醒你们，激发你们诚实的心。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>3:2 So that you may keep in mind the words of the holy prophets in the past, and the law of the Lord and Saviour which was given to you by his Apostles.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:2 叫你们记念圣先知预先所说的话，和主救主的命令，就是使徒所传给你们的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>3:3 Having first of all the knowledge that in the last days there will be men who, ruled by their evil desires, will make sport of holy things,
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:3 第一要紧的，该知道在末世必有好讥诮的人，随从自己的私欲出来讥诮说，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>3:4 Saying, Where is the hope of his coming? From the death of the fathers till now everything has gone on as it was from the making of the world.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:4 主要降临的应许在哪里呢？因为从列祖睡了以来，万物与起初创造的时候仍是一样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>3:5 But in taking this view they put out of their minds the memory that in the old days there was a heaven, and an earth lifted out of the water and circled by water, by the word of God;
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:5 他们故意忘记，从太古凭神的命有了天，并从水而出借水而成的地。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>3:6 And that the world which then was came to an end through the overflowing of the waters.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:6 故此，当时的世界被水淹没就消灭了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>3:7 But the present heaven and the present earth have been kept for destruction by fire, which is waiting for them on the day of the judging and destruction of evil men.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:7 但现在的天地，还是凭着那命存留，直留到不敬虔之人受审判遭沉沦的日子，用火焚烧。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>3:8 But, my loved ones, keep in mind this one thing, that with the Lord one day is the same as a thousand years, and a thousand years are no more than one day.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:8 亲爱的弟兄啊，有一件事你们不可忘记，就是主看一日如千年，千年如一日。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>3:9 The Lord is not slow in keeping his word, as he seems to some, but he is waiting in mercy for you, not desiring the destruction of any, but that all may be turned from their evil ways.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:9 主所应许的尚未成就，有人以为他是耽延，其实不是耽延，乃是宽容你们，不愿有一人沉沦，乃愿人人都悔改。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>3:10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief; and in that day the heavens will be rolled up with a great noise, and the substance of the earth will be changed by violent heat, and the world and everything in it will be burned up.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:10 但主的日子要像贼来到一样。那日天必大有响声废去，有形质的都要被烈火销化。地和其上的物都要烧尽了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>3:11 Seeing then that all these things are coming to such an end, what sort of persons is it right for you to be, in all holy behaviour and righteousness,
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:11 这一切既然都要如此销化，你们为人该当怎样圣洁，怎样敬虔，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>3:12 Looking for and truly desiring the coming of the day of God, when the heavens will come to an end through fire, and the substance of the earth will be changed by the great heat?
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:12 切切仰望神的日子来到。在那日天被火烧就销化了，有形质的都要被烈火熔化。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>3:13 But having faith in his word, we are looking for a new heaven and a new earth, which will be the resting-place of righteousness.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:13 但我们照他的应许，盼望新天新地，有义居在其中。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>3:14 For this reason, my loved ones, as you are looking for these things, take great care that when he comes you may be in peace before him, free from sin and every evil thing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:14 亲爱的弟兄啊，你们既盼望这些事，就当殷勤，使自己没有玷污，无可指摘，安然见主。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>3:15 And be certain that the long waiting of the Lord is for salvation; even as our brother Paul has said in his letters to you, from the wisdom which was given to him;
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:15 并且要以我主长久忍耐为得救的因由，就如我们所亲爱的兄弟保罗，照着所赐给他的智慧，写了信给你们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>3:16 And as he said in all his letters, which had to do with these things; in which are some hard sayings, so that, like the rest of the holy Writings, they are twisted by those who are uncertain and without knowledge, to the destruction of their souls.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:16 他一切的信上，也都是讲论这事。信中有些难明白的，那无学问不坚固的人强解，如强解别的经书一样，就自取沉沦。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>3:17 For this reason, my loved ones, having knowledge of these things before they take place, take care that you are not turned away by the error of the uncontrolled, so falling from your true faith.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:17 亲爱的弟兄啊，你们既然预先知道这事，就当防备，恐怕被恶人的错谬诱惑，就从自己坚固的地步上坠落。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>3:18 But be increased in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. May he have glory now and for ever. So be it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:18 你们却要在我们主救主耶稣基督的恩典和知识上有长进。愿荣耀归给他，从今直到永远。阿们。
