And David's servants were in fear of giving him the news of the child's death: for they said, Truly, while the child was still living he gave no attention when we said anything to him: what will he do to himself if we give him word that the child is dead?
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:18 到第七日，孩子死了。大卫的臣仆不敢告诉他孩子死了，因他们说，孩子还活着的时候，我们劝他，他尚且不肯听我们的话，若告诉他孩子死了，岂不更加忧伤吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>12:19 But when David saw that his servants were talking together quietly, he was certain that the child was dead: and he said to his servants, Is the child dead? and they said, He is.

Then David and all the people went back to Jerusalem.
