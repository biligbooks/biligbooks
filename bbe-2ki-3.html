And he said, I will go with you: I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:7 前行的时候，差人去见犹大王约沙法，说，摩押王背叛我，你肯同我去攻打摩押吗？他说，我肯上去，你我不分彼此，我的民与你的民一样，我的马与你的马一样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>3:8 And he said, Which way are we to go? And he said in answer, By the waste land of Edom.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>3:11 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there no prophet of the Lord here, through whom we may get directions from the Lord? And one of the king of Israel's men said in answer, Elisha, the son of Shaphat, is here, who was servant to Elijah.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:11 约沙法说，这里不是有耶和华的先知吗？我们可以托他求问耶和华。以色列王的一个臣子回答说，这里有沙法的儿子以利沙，就是从前服事以利亚的（原文作倒水在以利亚手上的）。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>3:12 And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the Lord is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.

</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:13 以利沙对以色列王说，我与你何干。去问你父亲的先知和你母亲的先知吧。以色列王对他说，不要这样说，耶和华招聚我们这三王，乃要交在摩押人的手里。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>3:14 Then Elisha said, By the life of the Lord of armies whose servant I am, if it was not for the respect I have for Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, I would not give a look at you, or see you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:14 以利沙说，我指着所事奉永生的万军耶和华起誓，我若不看犹大王约沙法的情面，必不理你，不顾你。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>3:23 Then they said, This is blood: it is clear that destruction has come on the kings; they have been fighting one another: now come, Moab, let us take their goods.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:23 就说，这是血阿。必是三王互相击杀，俱都灭亡。摩押人哪，我们现在去抢夺财物吧。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>3:24 But when they came to the tents of Israel, the Israelites came out and made a violent attack on the Moabites, so that they went in flight before them; and they went forward still attacking them;
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:24 摩押人到了以色列营，以色列人就起来攻打他们，以致他们在以色列人面前逃跑。以色列人往前追杀摩押人，直杀入摩押的境内，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>3:25 Pulling down the towns, covering every good field with stones, stopping up all the water-springs, and cutting down all the good trees; they went on driving Moab before them till only in Kir-hareseth were there any Moabites; and the fighting-men went round the town raining stones on it.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>3:26 And when the king of Moab saw that the fight was going against him, he took with him seven hundred men armed with swords, with the idea of forcing a way through to the king of Aram, but they were not able to do so.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:26 摩押王见阵势甚大，难以对敌，就率领七百拿刀的兵，要冲过阵去到以东王那里，却是不能。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>3:27 Then he took his oldest son, who would have been king after him, offering him as a burned offering on the wall. So there was great wrath against Israel; and they went away from him, back to their country.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">3:27 便将那应当接续他作王的长子，在城上献为燔祭。以色列人遭遇耶和华的大怒（或作招人痛恨），于是三王离开摩押王，各回本国去了。
