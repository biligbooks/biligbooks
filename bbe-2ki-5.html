</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>5:7 But the king of Israel, after reading the letter, was greatly troubled and said, Am I God, to give death and life? why does this man send a leper to me to be made well? is it not clear that he is looking for a cause of war?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:7 以色列王看了信就撕裂衣服，说，我岂是神，能使人死使人活呢？这人竟打发人来，叫我治好他的大麻疯。你们看一看，这人何以寻隙攻击我呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>5:8 Now Elisha, the man of God, hearing that the king of Israel had done this, sent to the king, saying, Why are you troubled? send the man to me, so that he may see that there is a prophet in Israel.

</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:11 乃缦却发怒走了，说，我想他必定出来见我，站着求告耶和华他神的名，在患处以上摇手，治好这大麻疯。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>5:12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not be washed in them and become clean? So turning, he went away in wrath.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>5:13 Then his servants came to him and said, If the prophet had given you orders to do some great thing, would you not have done it? how much more then, when he says to you, Be washed and become clean?
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:13 他的仆人进前来，对他说，我父阿，先知若吩咐你作一件大事，你岂不作吗？何况说你去沐浴而得洁净呢。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>5:14 Then he went down seven times into the waters of Jordan, as the man of God had said; and his flesh became like the flesh of a little child again, and he was clean.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>5:16 But he said, By the life of the Lord whose servant I am, I will take nothing from you. And he did his best to make him take it but he would not.

</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:17 乃缦说，你若不肯受，请将两骡子驮的土赐给仆人。从今以后，仆人必不再将燔祭或平安祭献与别神，只献给耶和华。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>5:18 But may your servant have the Lord's forgiveness for this one thing: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon for worship there, supported on my arm, and my head is bent in the house of Rimmon; when his head is bent in the house of Rimmon, may your servant have the Lord's forgiveness for this thing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:18 惟有一件事，愿耶和华饶恕你仆人，我主人进临门庙叩拜的时候，我用手搀他在临门庙，我也屈身。我在临门庙屈身的这事，愿耶和华饶恕我。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>5:19 And he said to him, Go in peace. And he went from him some distance.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:19 以利沙对他说，你可以平平安安地回去。乃缦就离开他去了。走了不远，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>5:20 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, the man of God, said, Now my master has taken nothing from Naaman, this Aramaean, of what he would have given him: by the living Lord, I will go after him and get something from him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:20 神人以利沙的仆人基哈西心里说，我主人不愿从这亚兰人乃缦手里受他带来的礼物，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，我必跑去追上他，向他要些。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>5:21 So Gehazi went after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from his carriage and went back to him and said, Is all well?
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:21 于是基哈西追赶乃缦。乃缦看见有人追赶，就急忙下车迎着他，说，都平安吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>5:22 And he said, All is well: but my master has sent me, saying, Even now, two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim; will you give me a talent of silver and two changes of clothing for them?
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:22 说，都平安。我主人打发我来说，刚才有两个少年人，是先知门徒，从以法莲山地来见我，请你赐他们一他连得银子，两套衣裳。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>5:23 And Naaman said, Be good enough to take two talents. And forcing him to take them, he put two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and gave them to his two servants to take before him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:23 乃缦说，请受二他连得。再三地请受，便将二他连得银子装在两个口袋里，又将两套衣裳交给两个仆人。他们就在基哈西前头抬着走。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>5:24 When he came to the hill, he took them from their hands, and put them away in the house; and he sent the men away, and they went.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:24 到了山冈，基哈西从他们手中接过来，放在屋里，打发他们回去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>5:25 Then he came in and took his place before his master. And Elisha said to him, Where have you come from, Gehazi? And he said, Your servant went nowhere.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:25 基哈西进去，站在他主人面前。以利沙问他说，基哈西你从哪里来。回答说，仆人没有往哪里去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>5:26 And he said to him, Did not my heart go with you, when the man got down from his carriage and went back to you? Is this a time for getting money, and clothing, and olive-gardens and vine-gardens, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants?
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:26 以利沙对他说，那人下车转回迎你的时候，我的心岂没有去呢？这岂是受银子，衣裳，买橄榄园，葡萄园，牛羊，仆婢的时候呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>5:27 Because of what you have done, the disease of Naaman the leper will take you in its grip, and your seed after you, for ever. And he went out from before him a leper as white as snow.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:27 因此，乃缦的大麻疯必沾染你和你的后裔，直到永远。基哈西从以利沙面前退出去，就长了大麻疯，像雪那样白。
