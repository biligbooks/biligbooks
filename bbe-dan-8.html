<origin onclick="showDiv('div_0');"> <p>8:1 In the third year of the rule of Belshazzar the king, a vision was seen by me, Daniel, after the one I saw at first.
</p></origin><translate id="div_0" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:1 伯沙撒王在位第三年，有异象现与我但以理，是在先前所见的异象之后。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>8:2 And I saw in the vision; and when I saw it, I was in the strong town Shushan, which is in the country of Elam; and in the vision I was by the water-door of the Ulai.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:2 我见了异象的时候，我以为在以拦省书珊城中（城或作宫）。我见异象又如在乌莱河边。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>8:3 And lifting up my eyes, I saw, there before the stream, a male sheep with two horns: and the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, the higher one coming up last.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:3 我举目观看，见有双角的公绵羊站在河边，两角都高。这角高过那角，更高的是后长的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>8:4 I saw the sheep pushing to the west and to the north and to the south; and no beasts were able to keep their place before him, and no one was able to get people out of his power; but he did whatever his pleasure was and made himself great.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:4 我见那公绵羊往西，往北，往南抵触。兽在它面前都站立不住，也没有能救护脱离它手的。但它任意而行，自高自大。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>8:5 And while I was giving thought to this, I saw a he-goat coming from the west over the face of all the earth without touching the earth: and the he-goat had a great horn between his eyes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:5 我正思想的时候，见有一只公山羊从西而来，遍行全地，脚不沾尘。这山羊两眼当中有一非常的角。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>8:6 And he came to the two-horned sheep which I saw before the stream, rushing at him in the heat of his power.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:6 它往我所看见，站在河边有双角的公绵羊那里去，大发忿怒，向它直闯。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>8:7 And I saw him come right up to the sheep, and he was moved with wrath against him, attacking the sheep so that his two horns were broken; and the sheep had not strength to keep his place before him, but was pushed down on the earth and crushed under his feet: and there was no one to get the sheep out of his power.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:7 我见公山羊就近公绵羊，向它发烈怒，抵触它，折断它的两角。绵羊在它面前站立不住。它将绵羊触倒在地，用脚践踏，没有能救绵羊脱离它手的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>8:8 And the he-goat became very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place came up four other horns turned to the four winds of heaven.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:8 这山羊极其自高自大，正强盛的时候，那大角折断了，又在角根上向天的四方（方原文作风）长出四个非常的角来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>8:9 And out of one of them came another horn, a little one, which became very great, stretching to the south and to the east and to the beautiful land.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:9 四角之中有一角长出一个小角，向南，向东，向荣美之地，渐渐成为强大。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>8:10 And it became great, even as high as the army of heaven, pulling down some of the army, even of the stars, to the earth and crushing them under its feet.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:10 它渐渐强大，高及天象，将些天象和星宿抛落在地，用脚践踏。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>8:11 It made itself great, even as great as the lord of the army; and by it the regular burned offering was taken away, and the place overturned and the holy place made waste.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:11 并且它自高自大，以为高及天象之君。除掉常献给君的燔祭，毁坏君的圣所。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>8:12 ... against the regular burned offering; and ... crushed down to the earth, and it did its pleasure and things went well for it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:12 因罪过的缘故，有军旅和常献的燔祭交付它。它将真理抛在地上，任意而行，无不顺利。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>8:13 Then there came to my ears the voice of a holy one talking; and another holy one said to that certain one who was talking, How long will the vision be while the regular burned offering is taken away, and the unclean thing causing fear is put up, and the holy place crushed under foot?
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:13 我听见有一位圣者说话，又有一位圣者问那说话的圣者说，这除掉常献的燔祭和施行毁坏的罪过，将圣所与军旅践踏的异象（军旅或作以色列的军），要到几时才应验呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>8:14 And he said to him, For two thousand, three hundred evenings and mornings; then the holy place will be made clean.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:14 他对我说，到二千三百日，圣所就必洁净。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>8:15 And it came about that when I, Daniel, had seen this vision, I had a desire for the sense of it to be unfolded; and I saw one before me in the form of a man.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:15 我但以理见了这异象，愿意明白其中的意思。忽有一位形状像人的站在我面前。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>8:16 And the voice of a man came to my ears between the sides of the Ulai, crying out and saying, Gabriel, make the vision clear to this man.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:16 我又听见乌莱河两岸中有人声呼叫说，加百列阿，要使此人明白这异象。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>8:17 So he came and took his place near where I was; and when he came, I was full of fear and went down on my face: but he said to me, Let it be clear to you, O son of man; for the vision has to do with the time of the end.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:17 他便来到我所站的地方。他一来，我就惊慌俯伏在地。他对我说，人子阿，你要明白，因为这是关乎末后的异象。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>8:18 Now while he was talking to me, I went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth: but touching me, he put me on my feet where I had been.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:18 他与我说话的时候，我面伏在地沉睡。他就摸我，扶我站起来，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>8:19 And he said, See, I will make clear to you what is to come in the later time of the wrath: for it has to do with the fixed time of the end.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:19 说，我要指示你恼怒临完必有的事，因为这是关乎末后的定期。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>8:20 The sheep which you saw with two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:20 你所看见双角的公绵羊，就是玛代和波斯王。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>8:21 And the he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn between his eyes is the first king.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:21 那公山羊就是希腊王（希腊原文作雅完下同）。两眼当中的大角就是头一王。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>8:22 And as for that which was broken, in place of which four came up, four kingdoms will come up from his nation, but not with his power.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:22 至于那折断了的角，在其根上又长出四角，这四角就是四国，必从这国里兴起来，只是权势都不及他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>8:23 And in the later years of their kingdom, when their evil doings have become complete, there will come up a king full of pride and expert in dark sayings.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:23 这四国末时，犯法的人罪恶满盈，必有一王兴起，面貌凶恶，能用双关的诈语。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>8:24 And his power will be great, and he will be purposing strange things. And all will go well for him and he will do his pleasure; and he will send destruction on the strong ones.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:24 他的权柄必大，却不是因自己的能力。他必行非常的毁灭，事情顺利，任意而行。又必毁灭有能力的和圣民。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>8:25 And his designs will be turned against the holy people, causing deceit to do well in his hand; in his heart he will make himself great, and send destruction on numbers who are living unconscious of their danger; and he will put himself up against the prince of princes; but he will be broken, though not by men's hands.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:25 他用权术成就手中的诡计，心里自高自大，在人坦然无备的时候，毁灭多人。又要站起来攻击万君之君，至终却非因人手而灭亡。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>8:26 And the vision of evenings and mornings which has been talked of is true: and keep the vision secret; for it has to do with the far-off future.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:26 所说二千三百日的异象是真的，但你要将这异象封住，因为关乎后来许多的日子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>8:27 And I, Daniel, was ill for some days; then I got up and did the king's business: and I was full of wonder at the vision, but no one was able to give the sense of it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:27 于是我但以理昏迷不醒，病了数日，然后起来办理王的事务。我因这异象惊奇，却无人能明白其中的意思。
