And the king said to the people, And I myself will certainly go out with you.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>18:3 But the people said, It is better for you not to go out: for if we are put to flight, they will not give a thought to us, and if death overtakes half of us, it will be nothing to them: but you are of more value than ten thousand of us: so it is better for you to be ready to come to our help from this town.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">18:3 军兵却说，你不可出战。若是我们逃跑，敌人必不介意。我们阵亡一半，敌人也不介意。因为你一人强似我们万人，你不如在城里预备帮助我们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>18:4 And the king said to them, I will do whatever seems best to you. So the king took his place by the door of the town, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.

</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">18:12 那人对约押说，我就是得你一千舍客勒银子，我也不敢伸手害王的儿子。因为我们听见王嘱咐你和亚比筛并以太说，你们要谨慎，不可害那少年人押沙龙。

</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">18:18 押沙龙活着的时候，在王谷立了一根石柱，因他说，我没有儿子为我留名。他就以自己的名称那石柱叫押沙龙柱，直到今日。

</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">18:22 撒督的儿子亚希玛斯又对约押说，无论怎样，求你容我随着古示人跑去。约押说，我儿，你报这信息，既不得赏赐，何必要跑去呢？
