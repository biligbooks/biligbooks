</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>6:2 It came out that it was recorded in the book how Mordecai had given word of the designs of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's servants, keepers of the door, by whom an attack on the king had been designed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:2 正遇见书上写着说，王的太监中有两个守门的，辟探和提列，想要下手害亚哈随鲁王，末底改将这事告诉王后。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>6:3 And the king said, What honour and reward have been given to Mordecai for this? Then the servants who were waiting on the king said, Nothing has been done for him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:3 王说，末底改行了这事，赐他什么尊荣爵位没有。伺候王的臣仆回答说，没有赐他什么。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>6:4 Then the king said, Who is in the outer room? Now Haman had come into the outer room to get the king's authority for the hanging of Mordecai on the pillar which he had made ready for him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:4 王说，谁在院子里。（那时哈曼正进王宫的外院，要求王将末底改挂在他所预备的木架上）
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>6:5 And the king's servants said to him, See, Haman is waiting in the outer room. And the king said, Let him come in.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:5 臣仆说，哈曼站在院内。王说，叫他进来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>6:6 So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What is to be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring? Then the thought came into Haman's mind, Whom, more than myself, would the king have pleasure in honouring?
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:6 哈曼就进去。王问他说，王所喜悦尊荣的人，当如何待他呢？哈曼心里说，王所喜悦尊荣的，不是我是谁呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>6:7 And Haman, answering the king, said, For the man whom the king has delight in honouring,
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:7 哈曼就回答说，王所喜悦尊荣的人，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>6:8 Let them take the robes which the king generally puts on, and the horse on which the king goes, and the crown which is on his head:
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:8 当将王常穿的朝服和戴冠的御马，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>6:9 And let the robes and the horse be given to one of the king's most noble captains, so that they may put them on the man whom the king has delight in honouring, and let him go on horseback through the streets of the town, with men crying out before him, So let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:9 都交给王极尊贵的一个大臣，命他将衣服给王所喜悦尊荣的人穿上，使他骑上马，走遍城里的街市，在他面前宣告说，王所喜悦尊荣的人，就如此待他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>6:10 Then the king said to Haman, Go quickly, and take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, who is seated at the king's doorway: see that you do everything as you have said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:10 王对哈曼说，你速速将这衣服和马，照你所说的，向坐在朝门的犹大人末底改去行。凡你所说的，一样不可缺。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>6:11 Then Haman took the robes and the horse, and dressing Mordecai in the robes, he made him go on horseback through the streets of the town, crying out before him, So let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:11 于是哈曼将朝服给末底改穿上，使他骑上马，走遍城里的街市，在他面前宣告说，王所喜悦尊荣的人，就如此待他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>6:12 And Mordecai came back to the king's doorway. But Haman went quickly back to his house, sad and with his head covered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:12 末底改仍回到朝门，哈曼却忧忧闷闷地蒙着头，急忙回家去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>6:13 And Haman gave his wife Zeresh and all his friends an account of what had taken place. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, If Mordecai, who is starting to get the better of you, is of the seed of the Jews, you will not be able to do anything against him, but you will certainly go down before him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:13 将所遇的一切事，详细说给他的妻细利斯，和他的众朋友听。他的智慧人，和他的妻细利斯对他说，你在末底改面前始而败落，他如果是犹大人，你必不能胜他，终必在他面前败落。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>6:14 While they were still talking, the king's servants came to take Haman to the feast which Esther had made ready.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:14 他们还与哈曼说话的时候，王的太监来催哈曼，快去赴以斯帖所预备的筵席。
