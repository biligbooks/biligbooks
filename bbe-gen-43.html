</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>43:2 And when the grain which they had got in Egypt was all used up, their father said to them, Go again and get us a little food.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:2 他们从埃及带来的粮食吃尽了，他们的父亲就对他们说，你们再去给我籴些粮来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>43:3 And Judah said to him, The man said to us with an oath, You are not to come before me again without your brother.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:3 犹大对他说，那人谆谆地告诫我们说，你们的兄弟若不与你们同来，你们就不得见我的面。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>43:4 If you will let our brother go with us, we will go down and get food:
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:4 你若打发我们的兄弟与我们同去，我们就下去给你籴粮。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>43:5 But if you will not send him, we will not go down: for the man said to us, You are not to come before me if your brother is not with you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:5 你若不打发他去，我们就不下去，因为那人对我们说，你们的兄弟若不与你们同来，你们就不得见我的面。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>43:6 And Israel said, Why were you so cruel to me as to say to him that you had a brother?
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:6 以色列说，你们为什么这样害我，告诉那人你们还有兄弟呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>43:7 And they said, The man put a number of questions to us about ourselves and our family, saying, Is your father still living? have you another brother? And we had to give him answers; how were we to have any idea that he would say, Come back with your brother?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:7 他们回答说，那人详细问到我们和我们的亲属，说，你们的父亲还在吗？你们还有兄弟吗？我们就按着他所问的告诉他，焉能知道他要说，必须把你们的兄弟带下来呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>43:8 Then Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the boy with me, and let us be up and going, so that we and you and our little ones may not come to destruction.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:8 犹大又对他父亲以色列说，你打发童子与我同去，我们就起身下去，好叫我们和你，并我们的妇人孩子，都得存活，不至于死。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>43:9 Put him into my care and make me responsible for him: if I do not give him safely back to you, let mine be the sin for ever.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:9 我为他作保。你可以从我手中追讨，我若不带他回来交在你面前，我情愿永远担罪。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>43:10 Truly, if we had not let the time go by, we might have come back again by now.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:10 我们若没有耽搁，如今第二次都回来了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>43:11 Then their father Israel said to them, If it has to be so, then do this: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels to give the man, perfumes and honey and spices and nuts:
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:11 他们的父亲以色列说，若必须如此，你们就当这样行，可以将这地土产中最好的乳香，蜂蜜，香料，没药，榧子，杏仁都取一点，收在器具里，带下去送给那人作礼物，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>43:12 And take twice as much money with you; that is to say, take back the money which was put in your bags, for it may have been an error;

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>43:13 And take your brother and go back to the man:
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:13 也带着你们的兄弟，起身去见那人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>43:14 And may God, the Ruler of all, give you mercy before the man, so that he may give you back your other brother and Benjamin. If my children are to be taken from me; there is no help for it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:14 但愿全能的神使你们在那人面前蒙怜悯，释放你们的那弟兄和便雅悯回来。我若丧了儿子，就丧了吧。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>43:15 So they took what their father said for the man, and twice as much money in their hands, and Benjamin, and went on their journey to Egypt, and came before Joseph.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:15 于是，他们拿着那礼物，又手里加倍地带银子，并且带着便雅悯，起身下到埃及，站在约瑟面前。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin, he said to his chief servant, Take these men into my house, and make ready a meal, for they will take food with me in the middle of the day.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:16 约瑟见便雅悯和他们同来，就对家宰说，将这些人领到屋里。要宰杀牲畜，预备筵席，因为晌午这些人同我吃饭。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>43:17 And the servant did as Joseph said, and took the men into Joseph's house.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:17 家宰就遵着约瑟的命去行，领他们进约瑟的屋里。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>43:18 Now the men were full of fear because they had been taken into Joseph's house and they said, It is because of the money which was put back in our bags the first time; he is looking for something against us, so that he may come down on us and take us and our asses for his use.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:18 他们因为被领到约瑟的屋里，就害怕，说，领我们到这里来，必是因为头次归还在我们口袋里的银子，找我们的错缝，下手害我们，强取我们为奴仆，抢夺我们的驴。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>43:19 So they went up to Joseph's chief servant at the door of the house,
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:19 他们就挨进约瑟的家宰，在屋门口和他说话，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>43:20 And said, O my lord, we only came down the first time to get food;
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:20 说，我主阿，我们头次下来实在是要籴粮。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>43:21 And when we came to our night's resting-place, on opening our bags we saw that every man's money was in the mouth of his bag, all our money in full weight: and we have it with us to give it back;
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:21 后来到了住宿的地方，我们打开口袋，不料，各人的银子，分量足数，仍在各人的口袋内，现在我们手里又带回来了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>43:22 As well as more money, with which to get food: we have no idea who put our money in our bags.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:22 另外又带下银子来籴粮。不知道先前谁把银子放在我们的口袋里。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>43:23 Then the servant said, Peace be with you: have no fear: your God, even the God of your father, has put wealth in your bags for you: I had your money. Then he let Simeon come out to them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:23 家宰说，你们可以放心，不要害怕，是你们的神和你们父亲的神赐给你们财宝在你们的口袋里。你们的银子，我早已收了。他就把西缅带出来，交给他们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>43:24 And the servant took them into Joseph's house, and gave them water for washing their feet; and he gave their asses food.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:24 家宰就领他们进约瑟的屋里，给他们水洗脚，又给他们草料喂驴。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>43:25 And they got ready the things for Joseph before he came in the middle of the day: for word was given to them that they were to have a meal there.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:25 他们就预备那礼物，等候约瑟晌午来，因为他们听见要在那里吃饭。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>43:26 And when Joseph came in, they gave him the things which they had for him, and went down to the earth before him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:26 约瑟来到家里，他们就把手中的礼物拿进屋去给他，又俯伏在地，向他下拜。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>43:27 And he said, How are you? is your father well, the old man of whom you were talking to me? is he still living?
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:27 约瑟问他们好，又问，你们的父亲就是你们所说的那老人家平安吗？他还在吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>43:28 And they said, Your servant, our father, is well, he is still living. And they went down on their faces before him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:28 他们回答说，你仆人我们的父亲平安。他还在。于是他们低头下拜。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>43:29 Then, lifting up his eyes, he saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother's son, and he said, Is this your youngest brother of whom you gave me word? And he said, God be good to you, my son.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:29 约瑟举目看见他同母的兄弟便雅悯，就说，你们向我所说那顶小的兄弟就是这位吗？又说，小儿阿，愿神赐恩给你。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>43:30 Then Joseph's heart went out to his brother, and he went quickly into his room, for he was overcome with weeping.
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:30 约瑟爱弟之情发动，就急忙寻找可哭之地，进入自己的屋里，哭了一场。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>43:31 Then, after washing his face, he came out, and controlling his feelings said, Put food before us.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:31 他洗了脸出来，勉强隐忍，吩咐人摆饭。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>43:32 And they put a meal ready for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who were with him by themselves; because the Egyptians may not take food with the Hebrews, for that would make them unclean.
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:32 他们就为约瑟单摆了一席，为那些人又摆了一席，也为和约瑟同吃饭的埃及人另摆了一席，因为埃及人不可和希伯来人一同吃饭。那原是埃及人所厌恶的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>43:33 And they were all given their seats before him in order of birth, from the oldest to the youngest: so that they were looking at one another in wonder.
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:33 约瑟使众弟兄在他面前排列坐席，都按着长幼的次序，众弟兄就彼此诧异。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>43:34 And Joseph sent food to them from his table, but he sent five times as much to Benjamin as to any of the others. And they took wine freely with him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">43:34 约瑟把他面前的食物分出来，送给他们。但便雅悯所得的比别人多五倍。他们就饮酒，和约瑟一同宴乐。
