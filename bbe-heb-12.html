</p></origin><translate id="div_0" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:1 我们既有这许多的见证人，如同云彩围着我们，就当放下各样的重担，脱去容易缠累我们的罪，存心忍耐，奔那摆在我们前头的路程，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>12:2 Having our eyes fixed on Jesus, the guide and end of our faith, who went through the pains of the cross, not caring for the shame, because of the joy which was before him, and who has now taken his place at the right hand of God's seat of power.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:2 仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣。（或作仰望那将真道创始成终的耶稣）他因那摆在前面的喜乐，就轻看羞辱，忍受了十字架的苦难，便坐在神宝座的右边。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>12:3 Give thought to him who has undergone so much of the hate of sinners against himself, so that you may not be tired and feeble of purpose.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:3 那忍受罪人这样顶撞的，你们要思想，免得疲倦灰心。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>12:4 Till now you have not given your blood in your fight against sin:
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:4 你们与罪恶相争，还没有抵挡到流血的地步。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>12:5 And you have not kept in mind the word which says to you as to sons, My son, do not make little of the Lord's punishment, and do not give up hope when you are judged by him;
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:5 你们又忘了那劝你们如同劝儿子的话，说，我儿，你不可轻看主的管教，被他责备的时候，也不可灰心。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>12:6 For the Lord sends punishment on his loved ones; everyone whom he takes as his son has experience of his rod.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:6 因为主所爱的他必管教，又鞭打凡所收纳的儿子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>12:7 It is for your training that you undergo these things; God is acting to you as a father does to his sons; for what son does not have punishment from his father?
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:7 你们所忍受的，是神管教你们，待你们如同待儿子。焉有儿子不被父亲管教的呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>12:8 But if you have not that punishment of which we all have our part, then you are not true sons, but children of shame.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:8 管教原是众子所共受的，你们若不受管教，就是私子，不是儿子了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>12:9 And again, if the fathers of our flesh gave us punishment and had our respect, how much more will we be under the authority of the Father of spirits, and have life?
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:9 再者，我们曾有生身的父管教我们，我们尚且敬重他，何况万灵的父，我们岂不更当顺服他得生吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>12:10 For they truly gave us punishment for a short time, as it seemed good to them; but he does it for our profit, so that we may become holy as he is.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:10 生身的父都是暂随己意管教我们。惟有万灵的父管教我们，是要我们得益处，使我们在他的圣洁上有分。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>12:11 At the time all punishment seems to be pain and not joy: but after, those who have been trained by it get from it the peace-giving fruit of righteousness.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:11 凡管教的事，当时不觉得快乐，反觉得愁苦。后来却为那经练过的人，结出平安的果子，就是义。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>12:12 For this cause let the hands which are hanging down be lifted up, and let the feeble knees be made strong,
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:12 所以你们要把下垂的手，发酸的腿，挺起来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>12:13 And make straight roads for your feet, so that the feeble may not be turned out of the way, but may be made strong.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>12:14 Let your desire be for peace with all men, and to be made holy, without which no man may see the Lord;
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:14 你们要追求与众人和睦，并要追求圣洁。非圣洁没有人能见主。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>12:15 Looking with care to see that no man among you in his behaviour comes short of the grace of God; for fear that some bitter root may come up to be a trouble to you, and that some of you may be made unclean by it;
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:15 又要谨慎，恐怕有人失了神的恩。恐怕有毒根生出来扰乱你们，因此叫众人沾染污秽。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>12:16 And that there may not be any evil liver, or any man without respect for God, like Esau, who let his birthright go for a plate of food.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:16 恐怕有淫乱的，有贪恋世俗如以扫的。他因一点食物把自己长子的名分卖了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>12:17 For you have knowledge that even long after, when he was desiring the blessing for his heritage, he was turned away, though he made his request frequently and with weeping; because the past might not be changed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:17 后来想要承受父所祝的福，竟被弃绝，虽然号哭切求，却得不着门路，使他父亲的心意回转，这是你们知道的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>12:18 You have not come to a mountain which may be touched, and is burning with fire, and to a black cloud, and a dark smoke, and a violent wind,
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:18 你们原不是来到那能摸的山，此山有火焰，密云，黑暗，暴风，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>12:19 And to the sound of a horn, and the voice of words, the hearers of which made request that not a word more might be said to them:
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:19 角声与说话的声音。那些听见这声音的。都求不要再向他们说话。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>12:20 For the order which said, If the mountain is touched even by a beast, the beast is to be stoned, seemed hard to them;
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:20 因为他们当不起所命他们的话说，靠近这山的，即便是走兽，也要用石头打死。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>12:21 And the vision was so overpowering that even Moses said, I am shaking and full of fear.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:21 所见的极其可怕，甚至摩西说，我甚是恐惧战兢。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>12:22 But you have come to the mountain of Zion, to the place of the living God, to the Jerusalem which is in heaven, and to an army of angels which may not be numbered,
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:22 你们乃是来到锡安山，永生神的城邑，就是天上的耶路撒冷。那里有千万的天使，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>12:23 To the great meeting and church of the first of those who are named in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of good men made complete,
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:23 有名录在天上诸长子之会所共聚的总会，有审判众人的神，和被成全之义人的灵魂。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>12:24 And to Jesus by whom the new agreement has been made between God and man, and to the sign of the blood which says better things than Abel's blood.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:24 并新约的中保耶稣，以及所洒的血。这血所说的比亚伯的血所说的更美。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>12:25 See that you give ear to his voice which comes to you. For if those whose ears were shut to the voice which came to them on earth did not go free from punishment, what chance have we of going free if we give no attention to him whose voice comes from heaven?
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:25 你们总要谨慎，不可弃绝那向你们说话的。因为那些弃绝在地上警戒他们的，尚且不能逃罪，何况我们违背那从天上警戒我们的呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>12:26 Whose voice was the cause of the shaking of the earth; but now he has made an oath, saying, There will be still one more shaking, not only of the earth, but of heaven.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:26 当时他的声音震动了地。但如今他应许说，再一次我不单要震动地，还要震动天。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>12:27 And the words, Still one more, make it clear that there will be a taking away of those things which are shaking, as of things which are made, so that there may be only those things of which no shaking is possible.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:27 这再一次的话，是指明被震动的，就是受造之物，都要挪去，使那不被震动的常存。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>12:28 If then, we have a kingdom which will never be moved, let us have grace, so that we may give God such worship as is pleasing to him with fear and respect:
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">12:28 所以我们既得了不能震动的国，就当感恩，照神所喜悦的，用虔诚敬畏的心事奉神。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>12:29 For our God is an all-burning fire.
