</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>19:3 You are to make ready a way, and see that the land which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage, is marked out into three parts, to which any taker of life may go in flight.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:3 要将耶和华你神使你承受为业的地分为三段。又要预备道路，使误杀人的，都可以逃到那里去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>19:4 This is to be the rule for anyone who goes in flight there, after causing the death of his neighbour in error and not through hate;
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:4 误杀人的逃到那里可以存活，定例乃是这样，凡素无仇恨，无心杀了人的，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>19:5 For example, if a man goes into the woods with his neighbour for the purpose of cutting down trees, and when he takes his axe to give a blow to the tree, the head of the axe comes off, and falling on to his neighbour gives him a wound causing his death; then the man may go in flight to one of these towns and be safe:
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:5 就如人与邻舍同入树林砍伐树木，手拿斧子一砍，本想砍下树木，不料，斧头脱了把，飞落在邻舍身上，以致于死，这人逃到那些城的一座城，就可以存活，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>19:6 For if not, he who has the right of punishment may go running after the taker of life in the heat of his wrath, and overtake him because the way is long, and give him a death-blow; though it is not right for him to be put to death because he was not moved by hate.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:6 免得报血仇的，心中火热追赶他，因路远就追上，将他杀死。其实他不该死，因为他与被杀的素无仇恨。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>19:7 And so I am ordering you to see that three towns are marked out for this purpose.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:7 所以我吩咐你说，要分定三座城。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>19:8 And if the Lord your God makes wide the limits of your land, as he said in his oath to your fathers, and gives you all the land which he undertook to give to your fathers;
