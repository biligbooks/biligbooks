</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:3 保罗说，这样，你们受的是什么洗呢？他们说，是约翰的洗。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>19:4 And Paul said, John gave a baptism which goes with a change of heart, saying to the people that they were to have faith in him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:4 保罗说，约翰所行的是悔改的洗，告诉百姓，当信那在他以后要来的，就是耶稣。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>19:5 And hearing this, they had baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:5 他们听见这话，就奉主耶稣的名受洗。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>19:6 And when Paul had put his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they had the power of talking in tongues, and acting like prophets.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:6 保罗按手在他们头上，圣灵便降在他们身上。他们就说方言，又说预言。（或作又讲道）。

</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:8 保罗进会堂，放胆讲道，一连三个月，辩论神国的事，劝化众人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>19:9 But because some of the people were hard-hearted and would not give hearing, saying evil words about the Way before the people, he went away from them, and kept the disciples separate, reasoning every day in the school of Tyrannus.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:9 后来有些人，心里刚硬不信，在众人面前毁谤这道，保罗就离开他们，也叫门徒与他们分离，便在推喇奴的学房，天天辩论。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>19:10 And this went on for two years, so that all those who were living in Asia had knowledge of the word of the Lord, Greeks as well as Jews.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:10 这样有两年之久，叫一切住在亚西亚的，无论是犹太人，是希利尼人，都听见主的道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>19:11 And God did special works of power by the hands of Paul:
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:11 神借保罗的手，行了些非常的奇事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>19:12 So that bits of linen and clothing from his body were taken to people who were ill, and their diseases went away from them and the evil spirits went out.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:12 甚至有人从保罗身上拿手巾，或围裙，放在病人身上，病就退了，恶鬼也出去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>19:13 But some of the Jews who went from place to place driving out evil spirits, took it on themselves to make use of the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, I give you orders, by Jesus, whom Paul is preaching.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:13 那时，有几个游行各处，念咒赶鬼的犹太人，向那被恶鬼附的人，擅自称主耶稣的名，说，我奉保罗所传的耶稣，敕令你们出来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>19:14 And there were seven sons of a man named Sceva, a Jew and a chief priest, who did this.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:14 作这事的，有犹太祭司长士基瓦的七个儿子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>19:15 And the evil spirit, answering, said to them, I have knowledge of Jesus, and of Paul, but who are you?

</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:16 恶鬼所附的人，就跳在他们身上，胜了其中二人，制伏他们，叫他们赤着身子受了伤，从那房子里逃出去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>19:17 And this came to the ears of all those, Jews and Greeks, who were living at Ephesus; and fear came on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was made great.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>19:18 And a number of those who had faith came and made a public statement of their sins and all their acts.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>19:19 And a great number of those who were experts in strange arts took their books and put them on the fire in front of everyone: and when the books were valued they came to fifty thousand bits of silver.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:19 平素行邪术的，也有许多人把书拿来，堆积在众人面前焚烧。他们算计书价，便知道共合五万块钱。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>19:20 So the word of the Lord was increased very greatly and was full of power.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:20 主的道大大兴旺而且得胜，就是这样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>19:21 Now after these things were ended, Paul came to a decision that when he had gone through Macedonia and Achaia he would go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I have a desire to see Rome.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:21 这些事完了，保罗心里定意，经过了马其顿，亚该亚就往耶路撒冷去，又说，我到了那里以后，也必须往罗马去看看。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>19:22 And having sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, he himself went on living in Asia for a time.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:22 于是从帮助他的人中，打发提摩太，以拉都二人，往马其顿去。自己暂时等在亚西亚。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>19:23 And about that time a great outcry took place about the Way.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:23 那时，因为这道起的扰乱不小。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>19:24 For there was a certain man named Demetrius, a silver-worker, who made silver boxes for the images of Diana, and gave no small profit to the workmen;
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:24 有一个银匠，名叫底米丢，是制造亚底米神银龛的，他使这样手艺人生意发达。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>19:25 Whom he got together, with other workmen of the same trade, and said to them, Men, it is clear that from this business we get our wealth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:25 他聚集他们和同行的工人，说，众位，你们知道我们是倚靠这生意发财。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>19:26 And you see, for it has come to your ears, that not only at Ephesus, but almost all through Asia, this Paul has been teaching numbers of people and turning them away, saying that those are not gods who are made by men's hands:
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:26 这保罗不但在以弗所，也几乎在亚西亚全地，引诱迷惑许多人，说，人手所作的不是神，这是你们所看见所听见的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>19:27 And there is danger, not only that our trade may be damaged in the opinion of men, but that the holy place of the great goddess Diana may be no longer honoured, and that she to whom all Asia and the world give worship, will be put down from her high position.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:27 这样，不独我们这事业，被人藐视，就是大女神亚底米的庙，也要被人轻忽，连亚西亚全地，和普天下，所敬拜的大女神之威荣，也要消灭了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>19:28 And hearing this, they were very angry, crying out and saying, Great is Diana of Ephesus.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:28 众人听见，就怒气填胸，喊着说，大哉以弗所人的亚底米阿。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>19:29 And the town was full of noise and trouble, and they all came running into the theatre, having taken by force Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia who were journeying in company with Paul.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:29 满城都轰动起来。众人拿住与保罗同行的马其顿人该犹和亚里达古，齐心拥进戏园里去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>19:30 And when Paul was about to go in to the people, the disciples did not let him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:30 保罗想要进去，到百姓那里，门徒却不许他去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>19:31 And some of the rulers of Asia, being his friends, sent to him, requesting him seriously not to put himself in danger by going into the theatre.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:31 还有亚西亚几位首领，是保罗的朋友，打发人来劝他，不要冒险到戏园里去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>19:32 And some said one thing, and some another: for there was no order in the meeting; and most of them had no idea why they had come together.
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:32 聚集的人，纷纷乱乱，有喊叫这个的，有喊叫那个的，大半不知道是为什么聚集。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>19:33 Then they took Alexander out from among the people, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander, making a sign with his hand, was about to make a statement to the people in answer:
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:33 有人把亚力山大从众人中带出来，犹太人推他往前，亚力山大就摆手，要向百姓分诉。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>19:34 But when they saw that he was a Jew, all of them with one voice went on crying out for about two hours, Great is Diana of Ephesus.
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:34 只因他们认出他是犹太人，就大家同声喊着说，大哉以弗所人的亚底米阿。如此约有两小时
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"> <p>19:35 And when the chief secretary had got the people quiet, he said, Men of Ephesus, is any man without knowledge that the town of Ephesus is the keeper of the holy place of the great Diana, who was sent down from Jupiter?
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:35 那城里的书记，安抚了众人，就说，以弗所人哪，谁不知道以弗所人的城，是看守大亚底米的庙，和从丢斯那里落下来的像呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>19:36 So then, because these things may not be doubted, it would be better for you to be quiet, and do nothing unwise.
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:36 这事既是驳不倒的，你们就当安静，不可造次。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"> <p>19:37 For you have taken these men, who are not doing damage to the holy place or talking against our goddess.
</p></origin><translate id="div_36" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:37 你们把这些人带来，他们并没有偷窃庙中之物，也没有谤？？我们的女神。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_37');"> <p>19:38 If, then, Demetrius and the workmen who are with him have a protest to make against any man, the law is open to them, and there are judges; let them put up a cause at law against one another.
</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:38 若是底米丢和他同行的人，有控告人的事，自有放告的日子。（或作自有公堂）也有方伯，可以彼此对告。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_38');"> <p>19:39 But if any other business is in question, let it be taken up in the regular meeting.
</p></origin><translate id="div_38" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:39 你们若问别的事，就可以照常例聚集断定。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"> <p>19:40 For, truly, we are in danger of being made responsible for this day's trouble, there being no cause for it: and we are not able to give any reason for this coming together.
</p></origin><translate id="div_39" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:40 今日的扰乱，本是无缘无故，我们难免被查问。论到这样聚众，我们也说不出所以然来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_40');"> <p>19:41 And when he had said this, he sent the meeting away.
</p></origin><translate id="div_40" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:41 说了这话，便叫众人散去。
