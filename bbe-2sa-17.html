</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>17:14 Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, Hushai's suggestion is better than that of Ahithophel. For it was the purpose of the Lord to make the wise designs of Ahithophel without effect, so that the Lord might send evil on Absalom.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:14 押沙龙和以色列众人说，亚基人户筛的计谋比亚希多弗的计谋更好。这是因耶和华定意破坏亚希多弗的良谋，为要降祸与押沙龙。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>17:15 Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, This is the suggestion made by Ahithophel to Absalom and the responsible men of Israel, and this is what I said to them.

</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:18 然而有一个童子看见他们，就去告诉押沙龙。他们急忙跑到巴户琳某人的家里。那人院中有一口井，他们就下到井里。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>17:19 And a woman put a cover over the hole, and put crushed grain on top of it, and no one had any knowledge of it.

</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:20 押沙龙的仆人来到那家，问妇人说，亚希玛斯和约拿单在哪里。妇人说，他们过了河了。仆人找他们，找不着，就回耶路撒冷去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>17:21 Then after the servants had gone away, they came up out of the water-hole and went to give King David the news; and they said, Get up and go quickly over the water, for such and such are Ahithophel's designs against you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:21 他们走后，二人从井里上来，去告诉大卫王说，亚希多弗如此如此定计害你，你们务要起来，快快过河。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>17:22 So David and all the people who were with him went up over Jordan: when dawn came, every one of them had gone over Jordan.

</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:23 亚希多弗见不依从他的计谋，就备上驴，归回本城。到了家，留下遗言，便吊死了，葬在他父亲的坟墓里。
