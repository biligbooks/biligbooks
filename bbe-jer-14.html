</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:14 耶和华对我说，那些先知托我的名说假预言，我并没有打发他们，没有吩咐他们，也没有对他们说话。他们向你们预言的，乃是虚假的异象和占卜，并虚无的事，以及本心的诡诈。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>14:15 So this is what the Lord has said about the prophets who make use of my name, though I sent them not, and say, The sword and need of food will not be in this land: the sword and need of food will put an end to those prophets.
