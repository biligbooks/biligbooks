</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>5:2 And after working the earth of it with a spade, he took away its stones, and put in it a very special vine; and he put up a watchtower in the middle of it, hollowing out in the rock a place for the grape-crushing; and he was hoping that it would give the best grapes, but it gave common grapes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:2 他刨挖园子，捡去石头，栽种上等的葡萄树，在园中盖了一座楼，又凿出压酒池。指望结好葡萄，反倒结了野葡萄。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>5:3 And now, you people of Jerusalem and you men of Judah, be the judges between me and my vine-garden.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>5:5 And now, this is what I will do to my vine-garden: I will take away the circle of thorns round it, and it will be burned up; its wall will be broken down and the beasts of the field will go through it;
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:5 现在我告诉你们，我要向我葡萄园怎样行。我必撤去篱笆，使它被吞灭，拆毁墙垣，使它被践踏。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>5:6 And I will make it waste; its branches will not be touched with the knife, or the earth worked with the spade; but blackberries and thorns will come up in it: and I will give orders to the clouds not to send rain on it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:6 我必使它荒废，不再修理，不再锄刨。荆棘蒺藜倒要生长。我也必命云不降雨在其上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>5:7 For the vine-garden of the Lord of armies is the people of Israel, and the men of Judah are the plant of his delight: and he was looking for upright judging, and there was blood; for righteousness, and there was a cry for help.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:7 万军之耶和华的葡萄园，就是以色列家，他所喜爱的树，就是犹大人。他指望的是公平，谁知倒有暴虐（或作倒流人血）。指望的是公义，谁知倒有冤声。

</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:12 他们在筵席上弹琴，鼓瑟，击鼓，吹笛，饮酒，却不顾念耶和华的作为，也不留心他手所作的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>5:13 For this cause my people are taken away as prisoners into strange countries for need of knowledge: and their rulers are wasted for need of food, and their loud-voiced feasters are dry for need of water.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>5:24 For this cause, as the waste of the grain is burned up by tongues of fire, and as the dry grass goes down before the flame, so their root will be like the dry stems of grain, and their flower will go up in dust: because they have gone against the law of the Lord of armies, and have given no honour to the word of the Holy One of Israel.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:24 火苗怎样吞灭碎秸，干草怎样落在火焰之中，照样，他们的根必像朽物，他们的花，必像灰尘飞腾。因为他们厌弃万军之耶和华的训诲，藐视以色列圣者的言语。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>5:25 For this reason the wrath of the Lord has been burning against his people, and his hand has been stretched out against them in punishment, and the hills were shaking, and their dead bodies were like waste in the open places of the town.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:25 所以耶和华的怒气向他的百姓发作，他的手伸出攻击他们，山岭就震动，他们的尸首在街市上好像粪土。虽然如此，他的怒气还未转消，他的手仍伸不缩。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>5:26 And he will let a flag be lifted up as a sign to a far-off nation, whistling to them from the ends of the earth: and they will come quickly and suddenly.
