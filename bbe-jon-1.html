</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>1:3 And Jonah got up to go in flight to Tarshish, away from the Lord; and he went down to Joppa, and saw there a ship going to Tarshish: so he gave them the price of the journey and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish, away from the Lord.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">1:3 约拿却起来，逃往他施去躲避耶和华。下到约帕，遇见一只船，要往他施去。他就给了船价，上了船，要与船上的人同往他施去躲避耶和华。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>1:4 And the Lord sent out a great wind on to the sea and there was a violent storm in the sea, so that the ship seemed in danger of being broken.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">1:4 然而耶和华使海中起大风，海就狂风大作，甚至船几乎破坏。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>1:5 Then the sailors were full of fear, every man crying to his god; and the goods in the ship were dropped out into the sea to make the weight less. But Jonah had gone down into the inmost part of the ship where he was stretched out in a deep sleep.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">1:5 水手便惧怕，各人哀求自己的神。他们将船上的货物抛在海中，为要使船轻些。约拿已下到底舱，躺卧沉睡。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>1:6 And the ship's captain came to him and said to him, What are you doing sleeping? Up! say a prayer to your God, if by chance God will give a thought to us, so that we may not come to destruction.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">1:6 船主到他那里对他说，你这沉睡的人哪，为何这样呢？起来，求告你的神，或者神顾念我们，使我们不至灭亡。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>1:7 And they said to one another, Come, let us put this to the decision of chance and see on whose account this evil has come on us. So they did so, and Jonah was seen to be the man.

</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">1:10 他们就大大惧怕，对他说，你做的是什么事呢？他们已经知道他躲避耶和华，因为他告诉了他们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>1:11 And they said to him, What are we to do to you so that the sea may become calm for us? For the sea was getting rougher and rougher.

</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">1:13 然而那些人竭力荡桨，要把船拢岸，却是不能。因为海浪越发向他们翻腾。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>1:14 So, crying to the Lord, they said, Give ear to our prayer, O Lord, give ear, and do not let destruction overtake us because of this man's life; do not put on us the sin of taking life without cause: for you, O Lord, have done what seemed good to you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">1:14 他们便求告耶和华说，耶和华阿，我们恳求你，不要因这人的性命使我们死亡，不要使流无辜血的罪归与我们。因为你耶和华是随自己的意旨行事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>1:15 So they took Jonah up and put him into the sea: and the sea was no longer angry.
