</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">23:3 保罗对他说，你这粉饰的墙。神要打你。你坐堂为的是按律法审问我，你竟违背律法，吩咐人打我吗？

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>23:5 And Paul said, Brother, I had no idea that he was the high priest: for it has been said, You may not say evil about the ruler of your people.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">23:5 保罗说，弟兄们，我不晓得他是大祭司。经上记着说，不可毁谤你百姓的官长。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>23:6 But when Paul saw that half of them were Sadducees and the rest Pharisees, he said in the Sanhedrin, Brothers, I am a Pharisee, and the son of Pharisees: I am here to be judged on the question of the hope of the coming back from the dead.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">23:6 保罗看出大众，一半是撒都该人，一半是法利赛人，就在公会中大声说，弟兄们，我是法利赛人，也是法利赛人的子孙。我现在受审问，是为盼望死人复活。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>23:7 And when he had said this, there was an argument between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and a division in the meeting.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">23:7 说了这话，法利赛人和撒都该人，就争论起来，会众分为两党。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>23:8 For the Sadducees say that there is no coming back from the dead, and no angels or spirits: but the Pharisees have belief in all these.

</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">23:9 于是大大地喧嚷起来。有几个法利赛党的文士站起来，争辩说，我们看不出这人有什么恶处，倘若有鬼魂，或是天使，对他说过话，怎么样呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>23:10 And when the argument became very violent, the chief captain, fearing that Paul would be pulled in two by them, gave orders to the armed men to take him by force from among them, and take him into the army building.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">23:10 那时大起争吵，千夫长恐怕保罗被他们扯碎了，就吩咐兵丁下去，把他从众人当中抢出来，带进营楼去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>23:11 And the night after, the Lord came to his side and said, Be of good heart, for as you have been witnessing for me in Jerusalem, so will you be my witness in Rome.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>23:21 But do not give way to them, for more than forty of them are waiting for him, having taken an oath not to take food or drink till they have put him to death: and now they are ready, waiting for your order.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">23:21 你切不要随从他们，因为他们有四十多人埋伏，已经起誓，说，若不先杀保罗，就不吃不喝。现在预备好了，只等你应允。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>23:22 So the chief captain let the young man go, saying to him, Do not say to anyone that you have given me word of these things.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">23:22 于是千夫长打发少年人走，嘱咐他说，不要告诉人你将这事报给我了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>23:23 And he sent for two captains and said, Make ready two hundred men, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, to go to Caesarea, at the third hour of the night:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>23:29 Then it became clear to me that it was a question of their law, and that nothing was said against him which might be a reason for prison or death.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">23:29 便查知他被告，是因他们律法的辩论，并没有什么该死该绑的罪名。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>23:30 And when news was given to me that a secret design was being made against the man, I sent him straight away to you, giving orders to those who are against him to make their statements before you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">23:30 后来有人把要害他的计谋告诉我，我就立时解他到你那里去，又吩咐告他的人，在你面前告他。（有古卷在此有愿你平安）
