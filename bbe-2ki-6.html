</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:4 于是以利沙与他们同去。到了约旦河，就砍伐树木。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>6:5 But one of them, while cutting a board, let the head of his axe go into the water; and he gave a cry, and said, This is a bad business, my master, for it is another's.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:5 有一人砍树的时候，斧头掉在水里，他就呼叫说，哀哉。我主阿，这斧子是借的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>6:6 And the man of God said, Where did it go in? and when he saw the place where it had gone into the water, cutting a stick, he put it into the water, and the iron came up to the top of the water.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:6 神人问说，掉在哪里了。他将那地方指给以利沙看。以利沙砍了一根木头，抛在水里，斧头就漂上来了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>6:7 Then he said, Take it up. So he put out his hand and took it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:7 以利沙说，拿起来吧。那人就伸手拿起来了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>6:8 At that time the king of Aram was making war against Israel; and he had a meeting with the chiefs of his army and said, I will be waiting in secret in some named place.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>6:10 So the king of Israel sent to the place where the man of God had said there was danger, and kept clear of it more than once.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:10 以色列王差人去窥探神人所告诉所警戒他去的地方，就防备未受其害，不止一两次。

</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:11 亚兰王因这事心里惊疑，召了臣仆来，对他们说，我们这里有谁帮助以色列王，你们不指给我吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>6:12 And one of them said, Not one of us, my lord king; but Elisha, the prophet in Israel, gives the king of Israel news of the words you say even in your bedroom.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>6:17 Then Elisha made a prayer to the Lord, saying, Lord, let his eyes be open so that he may see. And the Lord made the young man's eyes open; and he saw that all the mountain was full of horses and carriages of fire round Elisha.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:17 以利沙祷告说，耶和华阿，求你开这少年人的眼目，使他能看见。耶和华开他的眼目，他就看见满山有火车火马围绕以利沙。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>6:18 Now when the Aramaeans came down to Elisha, he made a prayer to the Lord saying, Lord, make this people blind. And he made them blind at Elisha's request.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:18 敌人下到以利沙那里，以利沙祷告耶和华说，求你使这些人的眼目昏迷。耶和华就照以利沙的话，使他们的眼目昏迷。

</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:19 以利沙对他们说，这不是那道，也不是那城。你们跟我去，我必领你们到所寻找的人那里。于是领他们到了撒玛利亚。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>6:20 And when they had come into Samaria, Elisha said, Lord, let the eyes of these men be open so that they may see. And the Lord made their eyes open, and they saw that they were in the middle of Samaria.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:20 他们进了撒玛利亚，以利沙祷告说，耶和华阿，求你开这些人的眼目，使他们能看见。耶和华开他们的眼目，他们就看见了，不料，是在撒玛利亚的城中。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>6:21 And the king of Israel, when he saw them, said to Elisha, My father, am I to put them to the sword?
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:21 以色列王见了他们，就问以利沙说，我父阿，我可以击杀他们吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>6:22 But he said in answer, You are not to put them to death; have you any right to put to death those whom you have not taken prisoner with your sword and your bow? put bread and water before them, so that they may have food and drink and go to their master.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:22 回答说，不可击杀他们。就是你用刀用弓掳来的，岂可击杀他们吗（或作也不可击杀，何况这些人呢？）？当在他们面前设摆饮食，使他们吃喝回到他们的主人那里。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>6:23 So he made ready a great feast for them, and when they had had food and drink, he sent them away and they went back to their master. And no more bands of Aramaeans came into the land of Israel.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:23 王就为他们预备了许多食物。他们吃喝完了，打发他们回到他们主人那里。从此，亚兰军不再犯以色列境了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>6:24 Now after this, Ben-hadad, king of Aram, got together all his army and went up to make an attack on Samaria, shutting the town in on all sides with his forces.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>6:25 And they became very short of food in Samaria; for they kept it shut in till the price of an ass's head was eighty shekels of silver, and a small measure of doves' droppings was five shekels of silver.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:25 于是撒玛利亚被围困，有饥荒，甚至一个驴头值银八十舍客勒，二升鸽子粪值银五舍客勒。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>6:26 And when the king of Israel was going by on the wall, a woman came crying out to him, and said, Help! my lord king.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:26 一日，以色列王在城上经过，有一个妇人向他呼叫说，我主，我王阿。求你帮助。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>6:27 And he said, If the Lord does not give you help, where am I to get help for you? from the grain-floor or the grape-crusher?
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:27 王说，耶和华不帮助你，我从何处帮助你。是从禾场，是从酒榨呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>6:28 And the king said to her, What is troubling you? And she said in answer, This woman said to me, Give your son to be our food today, and we will have my son tomorrow.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:28 王问妇人说，你有什么苦处。她回答说，这妇人对我说，将你的儿子取来，我们今日可以吃，明日可以吃我的儿子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>6:29 So, boiling my son, we had a meal of him; and on the day after I said to her, Now give your son for our food; but she has put her son in a secret place.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:29 我们就煮了我的儿子吃了。次日我对她说，要将你的儿子取来，我们可以吃。她却将她的儿子藏起来了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>6:30 Then the king, hearing what the woman said, took his robes in his hands, violently parting them; and, while he was walking on the wall, the people, looking, saw that under his robe he had haircloth on his flesh.
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:30 王听见妇人的话，就撕裂衣服。（王在城上经过）百姓看见王贴身穿着麻衣。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>6:31 Then he said, May God's punishment come on me if Elisha, the son of Shaphat, keeps his head on his body after this day.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:31 王说，我今日若容沙法的儿子以利沙的头仍在他项上，愿神重重地降罚与我。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>6:32 But Elisha was in his house, and the responsible men were seated there with him; and before the king got there, Elisha said to those who were with him, Do you see how this cruel and violent man has sent to take away my life?
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:32 那时，以利沙正坐在家中，长老也与他同坐。王打发一个伺候他的人去。他还没有到，以利沙对长老说，你们看这凶手之子，打发人来斩我的头。你们看着使者来到，就关上门，用门将他推出去。在他后头不是有他主人脚步的响声吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>6:33 While he was still talking to them, the king came down and said, This evil is from the Lord; why am I to go on waiting any longer for the Lord?
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:33 正说话的时候，使者来到，王也到了，说，这灾祸是从耶和华那里来的，我何必再仰望耶和华呢？
