</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>4:2 (Though, in fact, it was his disciples who gave baptism, not Jesus himself),
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:2 （其实不是耶稣亲自施洗，乃是他的门徒施洗）
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>4:3 He went out of Judaea into Galilee again.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:3 他就离了犹太，又往加利利去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>4:4 And it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:4 必须经过撒玛利亚。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>4:5 So he came to a town of Samaria which was named Sychar, near to the bit of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph:
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:5 于是到了撒玛利亚的一座城，名叫叙加，靠近雅各给他儿子约瑟的那块地。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>4:6 Now Jacob's fountain was there. Jesus, being tired after his journey, was resting by the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:6 在那里有雅各井。耶稣因走路困乏，就坐在井旁。那时约有午正。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>4:7 A woman of Samaria came to get water, and Jesus said to her, Give me some water.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:7 有一个撒玛利亚的妇人来打水。耶稣对她说，请你给我水喝。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>4:8 For his disciples had gone to the town to get food.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:8 那时门徒进城买食物去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>4:9 The woman of Samaria said to him, Why do you, a Jew, make a request for water to me, a woman of Samaria? She said this because Jews have nothing to do with the people of Samaria.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:9 撒玛利亚的妇人对他说，你既是犹太人，怎么向我一个撒玛利亚妇人要水喝呢？原来犹太人和撒玛利亚人没有来往。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>4:10 In answer Jesus said, If you had knowledge of what God gives freely and who it is who says to you, Give me water, you would make your prayer to him, and he would give you living water.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:10 耶稣回答说，你若知道神的恩赐，和对你说给我水喝的是谁，你必早求他，他也必早给了你活水。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>4:11 The woman said to him, Sir, you have no vessel and the fountain is deep; from where will you get the living water?
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:11 妇人说，先生没有打水的器具，井又深，你从哪里得活水呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>4:12 Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the fountain and took the water of it himself, with his children and his cattle?
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:12 我们的祖宗雅各，将这井留给我们。他自己和儿子并牲畜，也都喝这井里的水，难道你比他还大吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>4:13 Jesus said to her, Everyone who takes this water will be in need of it again:
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:13 耶稣回答说，凡喝这水的，还要再渴。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>4:14 But whoever takes the water I give him will never be in need of drink again; for the water I give him will become in him a fountain of eternal life.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>4:15 The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, so that I may not be in need again of drink and will not have to come all this way for it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:15 妇人说，先生，请把这水赐给我，叫我不渴，也不用来这么远打水。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>4:16 Jesus said to her, Go, get your husband and come back here with him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:16 耶稣说，你去叫你丈夫也到这里来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>4:17 In answer, the woman said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have said rightly, I have no husband:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>4:18 You have had five husbands, and the man you have now is not your husband: that was truly said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:18 你已经有五个丈夫。你现在有的，并不是你的丈夫。你这话是真的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>4:19 The woman said to him, Sir, I see that you are a prophet.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>4:20 Our fathers gave worship on this mountain, but you Jews say that the right place for worship is in Jerusalem.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>4:21 Jesus said to her, Woman, take my word for this; the time is coming when you will not give worship to the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:21 耶稣说，妇人，你当信我，时候将到，你们拜父，也不在这山上，也不在耶路撒冷。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>4:22 You give worship, but without knowledge of what you are worshipping: we give worship to what we have knowledge of: for salvation comes from the Jews.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:22 你们所拜的，你们不知道。我们所拜的，我们知道。因为救恩是从犹太人出来的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>4:23 But the time is coming, and is even now here, when the true worshippers will give worship to the Father in the true way of the spirit, for these are the worshippers desired by the Father.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:23 时候将到，如今就是了，那真正拜父的，要用心灵和诚实拜他，因为父要这样的人拜他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>4:24 God is Spirit: then let his worshippers give him worship in the true way of the spirit.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:24 神是个灵（或无个字）所以拜他的，必须用心灵和诚实拜他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>4:25 The woman said to him, I am certain that the Messiah, who is named Christ, is coming; when he comes he will make all things clear to us.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:25 妇人说，我知道弥赛亚，（就是那称为基督的）要来。他来了，必将一切的事都告诉我们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>4:26 Jesus said to her, I, who am talking to you, am he.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:26 耶稣说，这和你说话的就是他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>4:27 At that point the disciples came back, and they were surprised to see him talking to a woman; but not one of them said to him, What is your purpose? or, Why are you talking to her?
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:27 当下门徒回来，就希奇耶稣和一个妇人说话。只是没有人说，你是要什么？或说，你为什么和她说话？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>4:28 Then the woman put down her water-pot and went into the town, and said to the people,
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:28 那妇人就留下水罐子，往城里去，对众人说，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>4:29 Come and see a man who has been talking to me of everything I ever did! Is it possible that this is the Christ?
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:29 你们来看，有一个人将我素来所行的一切事，都给我说出来了，莫非这就是基督吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>4:30 So they went out of the town and came to him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:30 众人就出城往耶稣那里去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>4:31 While this was taking place, the disciples were saying to Jesus, Master, take some food.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:31 这其间，门徒对耶稣说，拉比请吃。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>4:32 But he said to them, I have food of which you have no knowledge.
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:32 耶稣说，我有食物吃，是你们不知道的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>4:33 So the disciples said one to another, Did anyone give him food?
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:33 门徒就彼此对问说，莫非有人拿什么给他吃吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>4:34 Jesus said, My food is to do the pleasure of him who sent me and to make his work complete.
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:34 耶稣说，我的食物，就是遵行差我来者的旨意，作成他的工。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"> <p>4:35 You would say, Four months from now is the time of the grain-cutting. Take a look, I say to you, at the fields; they are even now white for cutting.
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:35 你们岂不说，到收割的时候，还有四个月吗？我告诉你们，举目向田观看，庄稼已经熟了，（原文作发白）可以收割了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>4:36 He who does the cutting now has his reward; he is getting together fruit for eternal life, so that he who did the planting and he who gets in the grain may have joy together.
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:36 收割的人得工价，积蓄五谷到永生。叫撒种的和收割的一同快乐。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"> <p>4:37 In this the saying is a true one, One does the planting, and another gets in the grain.
</p></origin><translate id="div_36" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:37 俗语说，那人撒种，这人收割，这话可见是真的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_37');"> <p>4:38 I sent you to get in grain which you had no hand in planting: other men did that work, and you take the reward.
</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:38 我差你们去收你们所没有劳苦的。别人劳苦，你们享受他们所劳苦的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_38');"> <p>4:39 Now a number of the people of that town had faith in him because of the woman's witness: He has been talking to me of everything I ever did.
</p></origin><translate id="div_38" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:39 那城里有好些撒玛利亚人信了耶稣，因为那妇人作见证说，他将我素来所行的一切事，都给我说出来了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"> <p>4:40 So when the people came to him they made request to him to be among them for a time, and he was there two days.
</p></origin><translate id="div_39" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:40 于是撒玛利亚人来见耶稣，求他在他们那里住下。他便在那里住了两天。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_40');"> <p>4:41 And a great number more of them came to have faith in him because of what he himself said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_40" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:41 因耶稣的话，信的人就更多了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_41');"> <p>4:42 And they said to the woman, Now we have faith, but not because of your story: we ourselves have given ear to his words, and we are certain that he is truly the Saviour of the world.
</p></origin><translate id="div_41" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:42 便对妇人说，现在我们信，不是因为你的话，是我们亲自听见了，知道这真是救世主。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_42');"> <p>4:43 And after the two days he went on from there into Galilee.
</p></origin><translate id="div_42" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:43 过了那两天，耶稣离了那地方，往加利利去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_43');"> <p>4:44 For Jesus himself said that a prophet has no honour in the country of his birth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_43" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:44 因为耶稣自己作过见证说，先知在本地是没有人尊敬的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_44');"> <p>4:45 So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans took him to their hearts because of the things which they had seen him do in Jerusalem at the feast--they themselves having been there at the feast.
</p></origin><translate id="div_44" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:45 到了加利利，加利利人既然看见他在耶路撒冷过节所行的一切事，就接待他。因为他们也是上去过节。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_45');"> <p>4:46 So he came to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain man of high position whose son was ill at Capernaum.
</p></origin><translate id="div_45" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:46 耶稣又到了加利利的迦拿，就是他从前变水为酒的地方。有一个大臣，他的儿子在迦百农患病。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_46');"> <p>4:47 When it came to his ears that Jesus had come from Judaea into Galilee, he went to him and made a request that he would come down to his son, who was near to death, and make him well.
</p></origin><translate id="div_46" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:47 他听见耶稣从犹太到了加利利，就来见他，求他下去医治他的儿子。因为他儿子快要死了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_47');"> <p>4:48 Then Jesus said to him, You will not have faith if you do not see signs and wonders.
</p></origin><translate id="div_47" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:48 耶稣就对他说，若不看见神迹奇事，你们总是不信。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_48');"> <p>4:49 The man said, Sir, come down before my boy is dead.
</p></origin><translate id="div_48" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:49 那大臣说，先生，求你趁着我的孩子还没有死，就下去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_49');"> <p>4:50 And Jesus said, Go in peace; your son is living. The man had faith in the word which Jesus said to him and went away.
</p></origin><translate id="div_49" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:50 耶稣对他说，回去吧。你的儿子活了。那人信耶稣所说的话，就回去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_50');"> <p>4:51 And while he was going down, his servants came to him and said, Your boy is living.
</p></origin><translate id="div_50" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:51 正下去的时候，他的仆人迎见他，说，他的儿子活了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_51');"> <p>4:52 So he put a question to them as to the hour when he became better; and they said to him, The disease went from him yesterday at the seventh hour.
</p></origin><translate id="div_51" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:52 他就问什么时候见好的。他们说，昨日未时热就退了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_52');"> <p>4:53 It was clear then to the father that this was the very time at which Jesus said to him, Your son is living. And he had faith in Jesus, he and all his family.
</p></origin><translate id="div_52" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:53 他便知道这正是耶稣对他说，你儿子活了的时候，他自己和全家就都信了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_53');"> <p>4:54 Now this is the second sign which Jesus did after he had come out of Judaea into Galilee.
</p></origin><translate id="div_53" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:54 这是耶稣在加利利行的第二件神迹，是他从犹太回去以后行的。
