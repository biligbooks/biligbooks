<origin onclick="showDiv('div_0');"> <p>8:1 And now we give you news, brothers, about the grace of God which has been given to the churches of Macedonia;
</p></origin><translate id="div_0" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:1 弟兄们，我把神赐给马其顿众教会的恩告诉你们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>8:2 How while they were undergoing every sort of trouble, and were in the greatest need, they took all the greater joy in being able to give freely to the needs of others.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:2 就是他们在患难中受大试炼的时候，仍有满足的快乐，在极穷之间，还格外显出他们乐捐的厚恩。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>8:3 For I give them witness, that as they were able, and even more than they were able, they gave from the impulse of their hearts,
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:3 我可以证明他们是按着力量，而且也过了力量，自己甘心乐意的捐助。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>8:4 Seriously requesting us that they might have a part in this grace of being servants to the needs of the saints:
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:4 再三地求我们，准他们在这供给圣徒的恩情上有分。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>8:5 And going even farther than our hope, they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us after the purpose of God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:5 并且他们所作的，不但照我们所想望的，更照神的旨意，先把自己献给主，又归附了我们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>8:6 So that we made a request to Titus that, as he had made a start before, so he might make this grace complete in you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:6 因此我劝提多，既然在你们中间开办这慈惠的事，就当办成了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>8:7 And that as you are full of every good thing, of faith, of the word, of knowledge, of a ready mind, and of love to us, so you may be full of this grace in the same way.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:7 你们既然在信心，口才，知识，热心，和待我们的爱心上，都格外显出满足来，就当在这慈惠的事上，也格外显出满足来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>8:8 I am not giving you an order, but using the ready mind of others as a test of the quality of your love.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:8 我说这话，不是吩咐你们，乃是借着别人的热心，试验你们爱心的实在。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>8:9 For you see the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, how though he had wealth, he became poor on your account, so that through his need you might have wealth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:9 你们知道我们主耶稣基督的恩典。他本来富足，却为你们成了贫穷，叫你们因他的贫穷，可以成为富足。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>8:10 And in this I give my opinion: for it is to your profit, who were the first to make a start a year before, not only to do this, but to make clear that your minds were more than ready to do it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:10 我在这事上把我的意见告诉你们，是与你们有益。因为你们下手办这事，而且起此心意，已经有一年了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>8:11 Then make the doing of it complete; so that as you had a ready mind, you may give effect to it as you are able.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:11 如今就当办成这事。既有愿作的心，也当照你们所有的去办成。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>8:12 For if there is a ready mind, a man will have God's approval in the measure of what he has, and not of what he has not.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:12 因为人若有愿作的心，必蒙悦纳，乃是照他所有的，并不是照他所无的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>8:13 And I am not saying this so that others may get off free, while the weight comes on you:
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:13 我原不是要别人轻省，你们受累，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>8:14 But so that things may be equal; that from those things of which you have more than enough at the present time their need may be helped, and that if you are in any need they may be a help to you in the same way, making things equal.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:14 乃要均平。就是要你们的富余，现在可以补他们的不足，使他们的富余，将来也可以补你们的不足，这就均平了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>8:15 As it says in the Writings, He who had taken up much had nothing over and he who had little had enough.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:15 如经上所记，多收的也没有余，少收的也没有缺。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>8:16 But praise be to God, who puts the same care for you into the heart of Titus.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:16 多谢神，感动提多的心，叫他待你们殷勤，像我一样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>8:17 For while he gladly gave ear to our request, he was interested enough to go to you from the impulse of his heart.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:17 他固然是听了我的劝。但自己更是热心，情愿往你们那里去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>8:18 And with him we have sent a brother whose praise in the good news has gone through all the churches;
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:18 我们还打发一位兄弟和他同去。这人在福音上得了众教会的称赞。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>8:19 And not only so, but he was marked out by the churches to go with us in the grace of this giving which we have undertaken to the glory of the Lord and to make clear that our mind was ready:
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:19 不但这样，他也被众教会挑选，和我们同行，把所托与我们的这捐赀送到了，可以荣耀主，又表明我们乐意的心。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>8:20 And so that no man might be able to say anything against us in the business of this giving which has been put into our hands:
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:20 这就免得有人因我们收的捐银很多，就挑我们的不是。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>8:21 For the business has been so ordered by us as to have the approval, not only of the Lord, but of men.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:21 我们留心行光明的事，不但在主面前，就在人面前，也是这样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>8:22 And we have sent with them our brother, whose ready spirit has been made clear to us at times and in ways without number, but it is now all the more so because of the certain faith which he has in you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:22 我们又打发一位兄弟同去。这人的热心，我们在许多事上，屡次试验过，现在他因为深信你们，就更加热心了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>8:23 If any question comes up about Titus, he is my brother-worker, working with me for you; or about the others, they are the representatives of the churches to the glory of Christ.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:23 论到提多，他是我的同伴，一同为你们劳碌的。论到那两位兄弟，他们是众教会的使者，是基督的荣耀。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>8:24 Make clear then to them, as representatives of the churches, the quality of your love, and that the things which we have said about you are true.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:24 所以你们务要在众教会面前，显明你们爱心的凭据，并我所夸奖你们的凭据。
