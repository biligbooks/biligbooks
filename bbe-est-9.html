</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:2 犹大人在亚哈随鲁王各省的城里聚集，下手击杀那要害他们的人。无人能敌挡他们，因为各族都惧怕他们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>9:3 And all the chiefs and the captains and the rulers and those who did the king's business gave support to the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai had come on them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:3 各省的首领，总督，省长，和办理王事的人，因惧怕末底改，就都帮助犹大人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>9:4 For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and word of him went out through every part of the kingdom: for the man Mordecai became greater and greater.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>9:5 So the Jews overcame all their attackers with the sword and with death and destruction, and did to their haters whatever they had a desire to do.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:5 犹大人用刀击杀一切仇敌，任意杀灭恨他们的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>9:6 And in Shushan the Jews put to death five hundred men.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>9:11 On that day the number of those who had been put to death in the town of Shushan was given to the king.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:11 当日，将书珊城被杀的人数呈在王前。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>9:12 And the king said to Esther the queen, The Jews have put five hundred men to death in Shushan, as well as the ten sons of Haman: what then have they done in the rest of the kingdom! Now what is your prayer? for it will be given to you; what other request have you? and it will be done.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:12 王对王后以斯帖说，犹大人在书珊城杀灭了五百人，又杀了哈曼的十个儿子，在王的各省不知如何呢？现在你要什么，我必赐给你。你还求什么，也必为你成就。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>9:13 Then Esther said, If it is the king's pleasure, let authority be given to the Jews in Shushan to do tomorrow as has been done today, and let orders be given for the hanging of Haman's ten sons.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:13 以斯帖说，王若以为美，求你准书珊的犹大人，明日也照今日的旨意行，并将哈曼十个儿子的尸首挂在木架上。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>9:15 For the Jews who were in Shushan came together again on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and put to death three hundred men in Shushan; but they put not a hand on their goods.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:15 亚达月十四日书珊的犹大人又聚集在书珊，杀了三百人，却没有下手夺取财物。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>9:16 And the other Jews in every division of the kingdom came together, fighting for their lives, and got salvation from their haters and put seventy-five thousand of them to death; but they did not put a hand on their goods.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:16 在王各省其余的犹大人，也都聚集保护性命，杀了恨他们的人七万五千，却没有下手夺取财物。这样，就脱离仇敌，得享平安。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>9:17 This they did on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same month they took their rest, and made it a day of feasting and joy.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>9:19 So the Jews of the country places living in unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of feasting and joy and a good day, a day for sending offerings one to another.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:19 所以住无城墙乡村的犹大人，如今都以亚达月十四日为设筵欢乐的吉日，彼此馈送礼物。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>9:20 And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in every division of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, near and far,
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:20 末底改记录这事，写信与亚哈随鲁王各省远近所有的犹大人，

</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:21 嘱咐他们每年守亚达月十四，十五两日。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>9:22 As days on which the Jews had rest from their haters, and the month which for them was turned from sorrow to joy, and from weeping to a good day: and that they were to keep them as days of feasting and joy, of sending offerings to one another and good things to the poor.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:22 以这月的两日为犹大人脱离仇敌得平安，转忧为喜，转悲为乐的吉日。在这两日设筵欢乐，彼此馈送礼物，周济穷人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>9:23 And the Jews gave their word to go on as they had been doing and as Mordecai had given them orders in writing;
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:23 于是，犹大人按着末底改所写与他们的信，应承照初次所守的守为永例。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>9:24 Because Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the hater of all the Jews, had made designs for their destruction, attempting to get a decision by Pur (that is, chance) with a view to putting an end to them and cutting them off;
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:24 是因犹大人的仇敌，亚甲族哈米大他的儿子哈曼，设谋杀害犹大人，掣普珥，就是掣签，为要杀尽灭绝他们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>9:25 But when the business was put before the king, he gave orders by letters that the evil design which he had made against the Jews was to be turned against himself; and that he and his sons were to be put to death by hanging.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:25 这事报告于王，王便降旨使哈曼谋害犹大人的恶事，归到他自己的头上，并吩咐把他和他的众子都挂在木架上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>9:26 So these days were named Purim, after the name of Pur. And so, because of the words of this letter, and of what they had seen in connection with this business, and what had come to them,
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:26 照着普珥的名字，犹大人就称这两日为普珥日。他们因这信上的话，又因所看见所遇见的事，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>9:27 The Jews made a rule and gave an undertaking, causing their seed and all those who were joined to them to do the same, so that it might be in force for ever, that they would keep those two days, as ordered in the letter, at the fixed time every year;
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:27 就应承自己与后裔，并归附他们的人，每年按时必守这两日，永远不废。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>9:28 And that those days were to be kept in memory through every generation and every family, in every division of the kingdom and every town, that there might never be a time when these days of Purim would not be kept among the Jews, or when the memory of them would go from the minds of their seed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:28 各省各城，家家户户，世世代代纪念遵守这两日，使这普珥日在犹大人中不可废掉，在他们后裔中也不可忘记。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>9:29 Then Esther the queen, daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, sent a second letter giving the force of their authority to the order about the Purim.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:29 亚比孩的女儿王后以斯帖，和犹大人末底改以全权写第二封信，坚嘱犹大人守这普珥日。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>9:30 And he sent letters to all the Jews in the hundred and twenty-seven divisions of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with true words of peace,
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:30 用和平诚实话，写信给亚哈随鲁王国中，一百二十七省所有的犹大人，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>9:31 Giving the force of law to these days of Purim at their fixed times, as they had been ordered by Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen, and in keeping with the rules they had made for themselves and their seed, in connection with their time of going without food and their cry for help.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:31 劝他们按时守这普珥日，禁食呼求，是照犹大人末底改，和王后以斯帖，所嘱咐的。也照犹大人为自己与后裔所应承的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>9:32 The order given by Esther gave the force of law to the rules about the Purim; and it was recorded in the book.
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:32 以斯帖命定守普珥日，这事也记录在书上。
