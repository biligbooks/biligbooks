</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>10:5 And lifting up my eyes I saw the form of a man clothed in a linen robe, and round him there was a band of gold, of the best gold:
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">10:5 举目观看，见有一人身穿细麻衣，腰束乌法精金带。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>10:6 And his body was like the beryl, and his face had the look of a thunder-flame, and his eyes were like burning lights, and his arms and feet like the colour of polished brass, and the sound of his voice was like the sound of an army.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">10:6 他身体如水苍玉，面貌如闪电，眼目如火把，手和脚如光明的铜，说话的声音如大众的声音。

</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">10:7 这异象惟有我但以理一人看见，同着我的人没有看见。他们却大大战兢，逃跑隐藏，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>10:8 So I was by myself, and I saw this great vision, and all my strength went from me; and the colour went from my face.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">10:8 只剩下我一人。我见了这大异象便浑身无力，面貌失色，毫无气力。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>10:9 But the sound of his words came to my ears, and on hearing his voice I went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>10:16 Then one whose form was like the sons of men put his finger on my lips; and opening my mouth, I said to him who was before me, O my lord, because of the vision my pains have come on me, and I have no more strength.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">10:16 不料，有一位像人的，摸我的嘴唇，我便开口向那站在我面前的说，我主阿，因见这异象，我大大愁苦，毫无气力。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>10:19 And he said to me, O man greatly loved, have no fear: peace be with you, be strong and let your heart be lifted up. And at his words I became strong, and said, Let my lord say on, for you have given me strength.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">10:19 他说，大蒙眷爱的人哪，不要惧怕，愿你平安。你总要坚强。他一向我说话，我便觉得有力量，说，我主请说，因你使我有力量。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>10:20 Then he said, It is clear to you why I have come to you. And now I will give you an account of what is recorded in the true writings:
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">10:20 他就说，你知道我为何来见你吗？现在我要回去与波斯的魔君争战，我去后，希腊（原文作雅完）的魔君必来。
