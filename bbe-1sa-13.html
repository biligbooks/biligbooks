</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>13:4 And all Israel had the news that Saul had made an attack on the Philistines, and that Israel was bitterly hated by the Philistines. And the people came together after Saul to Gilgal.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:4 以色列众人听见扫罗攻击非利士人的防营，又听见以色列人为非利士人所憎恶，就跟随扫罗聚集在吉甲。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>13:5 And the Philistines came together to make war on Israel, three thousand war-carriages and six thousand horsemen and an army of people like the sands of the sea in number: they came up and took up their position in Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:5 非利士人聚集，要与以色列人争战，有车三万辆，马兵六千，步兵像海边的沙那样多，就上来在伯亚文东边的密抹安营。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>13:6 When the men of Israel saw the danger they were in, (for the people were troubled,) they took cover in cracks in the hillsides and in the woods and in rocks and holes and hollows.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:6 以色列百姓见自己危急窘迫，就藏在山洞，丛林，石穴，隐密处，和坑中。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>13:7 And a great number of the people had gone over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people went after him shaking in fear.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>13:13 And Samuel said to Saul, You have done a foolish thing: you have not kept the rules which the Lord your God gave you; it was the purpose of the Lord to make your authority over Israel safe for ever.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:13 撒母耳对扫罗说，你作了糊涂事了，没有遵守耶和华你神所吩咐你的命令。若遵守，耶和华必在以色列中坚立你的王位，直到永远。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>13:14 But now, your authority will not go on: the Lord, searching for a man who is pleasing to him in every way, has given him the place of ruler over his people, because you have not done what the Lord gave you orders to do.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:14 现在你的王位必不长久。耶和华已经寻着一个合他心意的人，立他作百姓的君，因为你没有遵守耶和华所吩咐你的。

</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:15 撒母耳就起来，从吉甲上到便雅悯的基比亚。扫罗数点跟随他的，约有六百人。

</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:17 有掠兵从非利士营中出来，分为三队，一队往俄弗拉向书亚地去，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>13:18 And another went in the direction of Beth-horon: and another went by the hill looking down on the valley of Zeboiim, in the direction of the waste land.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:18 一队往伯和仑去，一队往洗波音谷对面的地境向旷野去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>13:19 Now there was no iron-worker in all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, For fear the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears:
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:19 那时，以色列全地没有一个铁匠。因为非利士人说，恐怕希伯来人制造刀枪。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>13:20 But all the Israelites had to go to the Philistines to get their ploughs and blades and axes and hooks made sharp;
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:20 以色列人要磨锄，犁，斧，铲，就下到非利士人那里去磨。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>13:21 For they had instruments for putting an edge on their ploughs and blades and forks and axes, and for putting iron points on their ox-driving rods.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:21 但有锉可以锉铲，犁，三齿叉，斧子，并赶牛锥。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>13:22 So on the day of the fight at Michmash, not a sword or a spear was to be seen in the hands of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan: only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:22 所以到了争战的日子，跟随扫罗和约拿单的人没有一个手里有刀有枪的，惟独扫罗和他儿子约拿单有。
