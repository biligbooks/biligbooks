</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:23 亚撒黑仍不肯转开。故此，押尼珥就用枪？？刺入他的肚腹，甚至枪从背后透出，亚撒黑就在那里仆倒而死。众人赶到亚撒黑仆倒而死的地方，就都站住。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>2:24 But Joab and Abishai went after Abner: and the sun went down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is to the east of the road through the waste land of Geba.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:24 约押和亚比筛追赶押尼珥，日落的时候，到了通基遍旷野的路旁，基亚对面的亚玛山。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>2:26 Then crying out to Joab, Abner said, Are fighting and destruction to go on for ever? do you not see that the end will only be bitter? how long will it be before you send the people back and make them give up attacking their countrymen?
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:26 押尼珥呼叫约押说，刀剑岂可永远杀人吗？你岂不知终久必有苦楚吗？你要等何时才叫百姓回去，不追赶弟兄呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>2:27 And Joab said, By the living God, if you had not given the word, the people would have gone on attacking their countrymen till the morning.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:27 约押说，我指着永生的神起誓，你若不说戏耍的那句话，今日早晨百姓就回去，不追赶弟兄了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>2:28 So Joab had a horn sounded, and all the people came to a stop, and gave up going after Israel and fighting them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:28 于是约押吹角，众民就站住，不再追赶以色列人，也不再打仗了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>2:29 And all that night Abner and his men went through the Arabah; they went over Jordan and through all Bithron and came to Mahanaim.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:29 押尼珥和跟随他的人整夜经过亚拉巴，过约旦河，走过毕伦，到了玛哈念。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>2:30 And Joab came back from fighting Abner: and when he had got all his men together, it was seen that nineteen of David's men, in addition to Asahel, were not with them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:30 约押追赶押尼珥回来，聚集众民，见大卫的仆人中缺少了十九个人和亚撒黑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>2:31 But David's men had put to death three hundred and sixty of the men of Benjamin and of Abner's men
