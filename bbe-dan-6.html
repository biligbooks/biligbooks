</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>6:2 And over them were three chief rulers, of whom Daniel was one; and the captains were to be responsible to the chief rulers, so that the king might undergo no loss.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:2 又在他们以上立总长三人（但以理在其中），使总督在他们三人面前回覆事务，免得王受亏损。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>6:3 Then this Daniel did his work better than the chief rulers and the captains, because there was a special spirit in him; and it was the king's purpose to put him over all the kingdom.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:3 因这但以理有美好的灵性，所以显然超乎其余的总长和总督，王又想立他治理通国。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>6:4 Then the chief rulers and the captains were looking for some cause for putting Daniel in the wrong in connection with the kingdom, but they were unable to put forward any wrongdoing or error against him; because he was true, and no error or wrong was to be seen in him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:4 那时，总长和总督寻找但以理误国的把柄，为要参他。只是找不着他的错误过失，因他忠心办事，毫无错误过失。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>6:5 Then these men said, We will only get a reason for attacking Daniel in connection with the law of his God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:5 那些人便说，我们要找参这但以理的把柄，除非在他神的律法中就寻不着。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>6:6 Then these chief rulers and the captains came to the king and said to him, O King Darius, have life for ever.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:6 于是，总长和总督纷纷聚集来见王，说，愿大利乌王万岁。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>6:7 All the chief rulers of the kingdom, the chiefs and the captains, the wise men and the rulers, have made a common decision to put in force a law having the king's authority, and to give a strong order, that whoever makes any request to any god or man but you, O King, for thirty days, is to be put into the lions' hole.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:7 国中的总长，钦差，总督，谋士，和巡抚彼此商议，要立一条坚定的禁令（或作求王下旨要立一条云云），三十日内，不拘何人，若在王以外，或向神或向人求什么，就必扔在狮子坑中。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>6:8 Now, O King, put the order in force, signing the writing so that it may not be changed, like the law of the Medes and Persians which may not come to an end.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:8 王阿，现在求你立这禁令，加盖玉玺，使禁令决不更改。照玛代和波斯人的例是不可更改的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>6:9 For this reason King Darius put his name on the writing and the order.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:9 于是大利乌王立这禁令，加盖玉玺。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>6:10 And Daniel, on hearing that the writing had been signed, went into his house; (now he had windows in his room on the roof opening in the direction of Jerusalem;) and three times a day he went down on his knees in prayer and praise before his God, as he had done before.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:10 但以理知道这禁令盖了玉玺，就到自己家里（他楼上的窗户开向耶路撒冷），一日三次，双膝跪在他神面前，祷告感谢，与素常一样。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>6:12 Then they came near before the king and said, O King, have you not put your name to an order that any man who makes a request to any god or man but you, O King, for thirty days, is to be put into the lions' hole? The king made answer and said, The thing is fixed by the law of the Medes and Persians which may not come to an end.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:12 他们便进到王前，提王的禁令，说，王阿，三十日内不拘何人，若在王以外，或向神或向人求什么，必被扔在狮子坑中。王不是在这禁令上盖了玉玺吗？王回答说，实有这事，照玛代和波斯人的例，是不可更改的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>6:13 Then they made answer and said before the king, Daniel, one of the prisoners of Judah, has no respect for you, O King, or for the order signed by you, but three times a day he makes his prayer to God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:13 他们对王说，王阿，那被掳之犹大人中的但以理不理你，也不遵你盖了玉玺的禁令，他竟一日三次祈祷。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>6:14 When this thing came to the king's ears, it was very evil to him, and his heart was fixed on keeping Daniel safe, and till the going down of the sun he was doing everything in his power to get him free.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:14 王听见这话，就甚愁烦，一心要救但以理，筹划解救他，直到日落的时候。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>6:15 Then these men said to the king, Be certain, O King, that by the law of the Medes and Persians no order or law which the king has put into force may be changed.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>6:17 Then they got a stone and put it over the mouth of the hole, and it was stamped with the king's stamp and with the stamp of the lords, so that the decision about Daniel might not be changed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:17 有人搬石头放在坑口，王用自己的玺和大臣的印，封闭那坑，使惩办但以理的事毫无更改。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>6:18 Then the king went to his great house, and took no food that night, and no ... were placed before him, and his sleep went from him.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>6:20 And when he came near the hole where Daniel was, he gave a loud cry of grief; the king made answer and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whose servant you are at all times, able to keep you safe from the lions?
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:20 临近坑边，哀声呼叫但以理，对但以理说，永生神的仆人但以理阿，你所常事奉的神能救你脱离狮子吗？

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>6:22 My God has sent his angel to keep the lions' mouths shut, and they have done me no damage: because I was seen to be without sin before him; and further, before you, O King, I have done no wrong.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>6:23 Then the king was very glad, and gave orders for them to take Daniel up out of the hole. So Daniel was taken up out of the hole and he was seen to be untouched, because he had faith in his God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">6:23 王就甚喜乐，吩咐人将但以理从坑里系上来。于是但以理从坑里被系上来，身上毫无伤损，因为信靠他的神。
