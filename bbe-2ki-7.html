</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>7:2 Then the captain whose arm was supporting the king said to the man of God, Even if the Lord made windows in heaven, would such a thing be possible? And he said, Your eyes will see it, but you will not have a taste of the food.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:2 有一个搀扶王的军长对神人说，即便耶和华使天开了窗户，也不能有这事。以利沙说，你必亲眼看见，却不得吃。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>7:4 If we say, We will go into the town, there is no food in the town, and we will come to our end there; and if we go on waiting here, death will come to us. Come then, let us give ourselves up to the army of Aram: if they let us go on living, then life will be ours; and if they put us to death, then death will be ours.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:4 我们若说，进城去吧。城里有饥荒，必死在那里。若在这里坐着不动，也必是死。来吧，我们去投降亚兰人的军队，他们若留我们的活命，就活着。若杀我们，就死了吧。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>7:5 So in the half light they got up to go to the tents of Aram; but when they came to the outer line of tents, there was no one there.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>7:6 For the Lord had made the sound of carriages and horses, and the noise of a great army, come to the ears of the Aramaeans, so that they said to one another, Truly, the king of Israel has got the kings of the Hittites and of the Egyptians for a price to make an attack on us.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:6 因为主使亚兰人的军队听见车马的声音，是大军的声音。他们就彼此说，这必是以色列王贿买赫人的诸王和埃及人的诸王来攻击我们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>7:7 So they got up and went in flight, in the half light, without their tents or their horses or their asses or any of their goods; they went in flight, fearing for their lives.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:7 所以，在黄昏的时候他们起来逃跑，撇下帐棚，马，驴，营盘照旧，只顾逃命。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>7:8 And when those lepers came to the outer line of tents, they went into one tent, and had food and drink, and took from it silver and gold and clothing, which they put in a secret place; then they came back and went into another tent from which they took more goods, which they put away in a secret place.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:8 那些长大麻疯的到了营边，进了帐棚，吃了喝了，且从其中拿出金银和衣服来，去收藏了。回来又进了一座帐棚，从其中拿出财物来去收藏了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>7:9 Then they said to one another, We are not doing right. Today is a day of good news, and we say nothing: if we go on waiting here till the morning, punishment will come to us. So let us go and give the news to those of the king's house.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:9 那时，他们彼此说，我们所作的不好。今日是有好信息的日子，我们竟不作声。若等到天亮，罪必临到我们。来吧，我们与王家报信去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>7:10 So they came in, and, crying out to the door-keepers of the town, they gave them the news, saying, We came to the tents of the Aramaeans, and there was no one there and no voice of man, only the horses and the asses in their places, and the tents as they were.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>7:12 Then the king got up in the night and said to his servants, This is my idea of what the Aramaeans have done to us. They have knowledge that we are without food; and so they have gone out of their tents, and are waiting secretly in the open country, saying, When they come out of the town, we will take them living and get into the town.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:12 王夜间起来，对臣仆说，我告诉你们亚兰人向我们如何行。他们知道我们饥饿，所以离营，埋伏在田野，说，以色列人出城的时候，我们就活捉他们，得以进城。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>7:13 And one of his servants said in answer, Send men and let them take five of the horses which we still have in the town; if they keep their lives they will be the same as those of Israel who are still living here; if they come to their death they will be the same as all those of Israel who have gone to destruction: let us send and see.

</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:14 于是取了两辆车和马，王差人去追寻亚兰军，说，你们去窥探窥探。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>7:15 And they went after them as far as Jordan; and all the road was covered with clothing and vessels dropped by the Aramaeans in their flight. So those who were sent went back and gave the news to the king.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:15 他们就追寻到约旦河，看见满道上都是亚兰人急跑时丢弃的衣服器具，使者就回来报告王。

</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:16 众人就出去，掳掠亚兰人的营盘。于是一细亚细面卖银一舍客勒，二细亚大麦也卖银一舍客勒，正如耶和华所说的。
