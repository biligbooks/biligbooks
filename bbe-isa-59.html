</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>59:2 But your sins have come between you and your God, and by your evil doings his face has been veiled from you, so that he will give you no answer.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:2 但你们的罪孽使你们与神隔绝，你们的罪恶使他掩面不听你们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>59:3 For your hands are unclean with blood, and your fingers with sin; your lips have said false things, and your tongue gives out deceit.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:3 因你们的手被血沾染，你们的指头被罪孽沾污。你们的嘴唇说谎言，你们的舌头出恶语。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>59:4 No one puts forward an upright cause, or gives a true decision: their hope is in deceit, and their words are false; they are with child with sin, and give birth to evil.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:4 无一人按公义告状，无一人凭诚实辨白。都倚靠虚妄，说谎言。所怀的是毒害，所生的是罪孽。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>59:5 They give birth to snake's eggs, and make spider's threads: whoever takes their eggs for food comes to his death, and the egg which is crushed becomes a poison-snake.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:5 他们抱毒蛇蛋，结蜘蛛网。人吃这蛋必死。这蛋被踏，必出蝮蛇。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>59:6 Their twisted threads will not make clothing, and their works will give them nothing for covering themselves: their works are works of sin, and violent acts are in their hands.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:6 所结的网，不能成为衣服，所作的，也不能遮盖自己。他们的行为都是罪孽，手所作的都是强暴。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>59:7 Their feet go quickly to evil, and they take delight in the death of the upright; their thoughts are thoughts of sin; wasting and destruction are in their ways.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:7 他们的脚奔跑行恶，他们急速流无辜人的血。意念都是罪孽。所经过的路都荒凉毁灭。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>59:8 They have no knowledge of the way of peace, and there is no sense of what is right in their behaviour: they have made for themselves ways which are not straight; whoever goes in them has no knowledge of peace.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:8 平安的路，他们不知道。所行的事没有公平。他们为自己修弯曲的路。凡行此路的，都不知道平安。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>59:9 For this cause our right is far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us: we are looking for light, but there is only the dark; for the shining of the sun, but our way is in the night.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:9 因此公平离我们远，公义追不上我们。我们指望光亮，却是黑暗。指望光明，却行幽暗。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>59:10 We go on our way, like blind men feeling for the wall, even like those who have no eyes: we are running against things in daylight as if it was evening; our place is in the dark like dead men.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:10 我们摸索墙壁，好像瞎子。我们摸索如同无目之人。我们晌午绊脚，如在黄昏一样。我们在肥壮人中，像死人一般。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>59:11 We make noises of grief, like bears, and sad sounds like doves: we are looking for our right, but it is not there; for salvation, but it is far from us.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:11 我们咆哮如熊，哀鸣如鸽。指望公平，却是没有。指望救恩，却远离我们。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>59:13 We have gone against the Lord, and been false to him, turning away from our God, our words have been uncontrolled, and in our hearts are thoughts of deceit.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>59:14 And the right is turned back, and righteousness is far away: for good faith is not to be seen in the public places, and upright behaviour may not come into the town.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:14 并且公平转而退后，公义站在远处。诚实在街上仆倒，正直也不得进入。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>59:15 Yes, faith is gone; and he whose heart is turned from evil comes into the power of the cruel: and the Lord saw it, and he was angry that there was no one to take up their cause.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:15 诚实少见。离恶的人反成掠物。那时，耶和华看见没有公平，甚不喜悦。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>59:16 And he saw that there was no man, and was surprised that there was no one to take up their cause: so his arm gave salvation, and he made righteousness his support.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:16 他见无人拯救，无人代求，甚为诧异。就用自己的膀臂施行拯救。以公义扶持自己。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>59:17 Yes, he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and salvation as a head-dress; and he put on punishment as clothing, and wrath as a robe.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:17 他以公义为铠甲，（或作护心镜）以拯救为头盔，以报仇为衣服，以热心为外袍。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>59:18 He will give them the right reward of their doings, wrath to his attackers, punishment to his haters, and even on the sea-lands he will send punishment.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:18 他必按人的行为施报，恼怒他的敌人，报复他的仇敌，向众海岛施行报应。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>59:19 So they will see the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the east: for he will come like a rushing stream, forced on by a wind of the Lord.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:19 如此，人从日落之处，必敬畏耶和华的名。从日出之地，也必敬畏他的荣耀。因为仇敌好像急流的河水冲来，是耶和华之气所驱逐的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>59:20 And as a saviour he will come to Zion, turning away sin from Jacob, says the Lord.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">59:20 必有一位救赎主，来到锡安雅各族中转离过犯的人那里。这是耶和华说的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>59:21 And as for me, this is my agreement with them, says the Lord: my spirit which is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, will not go away from your mouth, or from the mouth of your seed, or from the mouth of your seed's seed, says the Lord, from now and for ever.
