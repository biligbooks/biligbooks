</p></origin><translate id="div_0" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:1 如此说来，我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕，凭着肉体得了什么呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>4:2 For if Abraham got righteousness by works, he has reason for pride; but not before God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:2 倘若亚伯拉罕是因行为称义，就有可夸的。只是在神面前并无可夸。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>4:3 But what does it say in the holy Writings? And Abraham had faith in God, and it was put to his account as righteousness.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:3 经上说什么呢？说，亚伯拉罕信神，这就算为他的义。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>4:4 Now, the reward is credited to him who does works, not as of grace but as a debt.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:4 作工的得工价，不算恩典，乃是该得的，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>4:5 But to him who without working has faith in him who gives righteousness to the evil-doer, his faith is put to his account as righteousness.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:5 惟有不作工的，只信称罪人为义的神，他的信就算为义。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>4:6 As David says that there is a blessing on the man to whose account God puts righteousness without works, saying,
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:6 正如大卫称那在行为以外，蒙神算为义的人是有福的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>4:7 Happy are those who have forgiveness for their wrongdoing, and whose sins are covered.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:7 他说，得赦免其过，遮盖其罪的，这人是有福的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>4:8 Happy is the man against whom no sin is recorded by the Lord.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:8 主不算为有罪的，这人是有福的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>4:9 Is this blessing, then, for the circumcision only, or in the same way for those who have not circumcision? for we say that the faith of Abraham was put to his account as righteousness.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:9 如此看来，这福是单加给那受割礼的人吗？不也是加给那未受割礼的人吗？因我们所说，亚伯拉罕的信，就算为他的义。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>4:10 How, then, was it judged? when he had circumcision, or when he had it not? Not when he had it, but when he did not have it:
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:10 是怎么算的呢？是在他受割礼的时候呢？是在他未受割礼的时候呢？不是在受割礼的时候，乃是在未受割礼的时候。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>4:11 And he was given the sign of circumcision as a witness of the faith which he had before he underwent circumcision: so that he might be the father of all those who have faith, though they have not circumcision, and so that righteousness might be put to their account;
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:11 并且他受了割礼的记号，作他未受割礼的时候因信称义的印证，叫他作一切未受割礼而信之人的父，使他们也算为义。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>4:12 And the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who keep to the way of that faith which our father Abraham had before he underwent circumcision.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:12 又作受割礼之人的父，就是那些不但受割礼，并且按我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕，未受割礼而信之踪迹去行的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>4:13 For God's word, that the earth would be his heritage, was given to Abraham, not through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:13 因为神应许亚伯拉罕和他后裔，必得承受世界，不是因律法，乃是因信而得的义。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>4:14 For if they who are of the law are the people who get the heritage, then faith is made of no use, and the word of God has no power;
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:14 若是属乎律法的人，才得为后嗣，信就归于虚空，应许也就废弃了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>4:15 For the outcome of the law is wrath; but where there is no law it will not be broken.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:15 因为律法是惹动忿怒的。（或作叫人受刑的）哪里没有律法，哪里就没有过犯。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>4:16 For this reason it is of faith, so that it may be through grace; and so that the word of God may be certain to all the seed; not only to that which is of the law, but to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:16 所以人得为后嗣是本乎信。因此就属乎恩。叫应许定然归给一切后裔。不但归给那属乎律法的，也归给那效法亚伯拉罕之信的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>4:17 (As it is said in the holy Writings, I have made you a father of a number of nations) before him in whom he had faith, that is, God, who gives life to the dead, and to whom the things which are not are as if they were.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:17 亚伯拉罕所信的，是那叫死人复活使无变为有的神，他在主面前作我们世人的父。如经上所记，我已经立你作多国的父。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>4:18 Who without reason for hope, in faith went on hoping, so that he became the father of a number of nations, as it had been said, So will your seed be.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:18 他在无可指望的时候，因信仍有指望，就得以作多国的父，正如先前所说，你的后裔将要如此。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>4:19 And not being feeble in faith though his body seemed to him little better than dead (he being about a hundred years old) and Sarah was no longer able to have children:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>4:20 Still, he did not give up faith in the undertaking of God, but was made strong by faith, giving glory to God,
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:20 并且仰望神的应许，总没有因不信，心里起疑惑。反倒因信，心里得坚固，将荣耀归给神。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>4:21 And being certain that God was able to keep his word.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:21 且满心相信，神所应许的必能作成。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>4:22 For which reason it was put to his account as righteousness.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:22 所以这就算为他的义。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>4:23 Now, it was not because of him only that this was said,
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:23 算为他义的这句话，不是单为他写的，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>4:24 But for us in addition, to whose account it will be put, if we have faith in him who made Jesus our Lord come back again from the dead,
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:24 也是为我们将来得算为义之人写的。就是我们这信神使我们的主耶稣从死里复活的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>4:25 Who was put to death for our evil-doing, and came to life again so that we might have righteousness.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:25 耶稣被交给人，是为我们的过犯，复活是为叫我们称义。（或作耶稣是为我们的过犯交付了是为我们称义复活了）
