</p></origin><translate id="div_40" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:41 他们就把石头挪开。耶稣举目望天说，父阿，我感谢你，因为你已经听我。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_41');"> <p>11:42 I was certain that your ears are at all times open to me, but I said it because of these who are here, so that they may see that you sent me.
</p></origin><translate id="div_41" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:42 我也知道你常听我，但我说这话，是为周围站着的众人，叫他们信是你差了我来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_42');"> <p>11:43 Then he said in a loud voice, Lazarus, come out!
</p></origin><translate id="div_42" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:43 说了这话，就大声呼叫说，拉撒路出来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_43');"> <p>11:44 And he who was dead came out, with linen bands folded tightly about his hands and feet, and a cloth about his face. Jesus said to them, Make him free and let him go.
</p></origin><translate id="div_43" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:44 那死人就出来了，手脚裹着布，脸上包着手巾。耶稣对他们说，解开，叫他走。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_44');"> <p>11:45 Then a number of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did had belief in him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_44" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:45 那些来看马利亚的犹太人，见了耶稣所作的事，就多有信他的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_45');"> <p>11:46 But some of them went to the Pharisees with the news of what Jesus had done.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_46');"> <p>11:47 Then the high priests and the Pharisees had a meeting and said, What are we doing? This man is doing a number of signs.
</p></origin><translate id="div_46" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:47 祭司长和法利赛人聚集公会，说，这人行好些神迹，我们怎么办呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_47');"> <p>11:48 If we let him go on in this way, everybody will have belief in him and the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation.
</p></origin><translate id="div_47" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:48 若这样由着他，人人都要信他。罗马人也要来夺我们的地土，和我们的百姓。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_48');"> <p>11:49 But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, You have no knowledge of anything;
</p></origin><translate id="div_48" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:49 内中有一个人，名叫该亚法，本年作大祭司，对他们说，你们不知道什么。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_49');"> <p>11:50 You do not see that it is in your interest for one man to be put to death for the people, so that all the nation may not come to destruction.
</p></origin><translate id="div_49" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:50 独不想一个人替百姓死，免得通国灭亡，就是你们的益处。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_50');"> <p>11:51 He did not say this of himself, but being the high priest that year he said, as a prophet, that Jesus would be put to death for the nation;
</p></origin><translate id="div_50" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:51 他这话不是出于自己，是因他本年作大祭司，所以预言耶稣将要替这一国死。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_51');"> <p>11:52 And not for that nation only, but for the purpose of uniting in one body the children of God all over the world.
</p></origin><translate id="div_51" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:52 也不但替这一国死，并要将神四散的子民，都聚集归一。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_52');"> <p>11:53 And from that day they took thought together how to put him to death.
</p></origin><translate id="div_52" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:53 从那日起，他们就商议要杀耶稣。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_53');"> <p>11:54 So Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near to the waste land, to a town named Ephraim, where he was for some time with the disciples.
</p></origin><translate id="div_53" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:54 所以耶稣不再显然行在犹太人中间，就离开那里往靠近旷野的地方去。到了一座城，名叫以法莲，就在那里和门徒同住。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_54');"> <p>11:55 Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and numbers of people went up from the country to Jerusalem to make themselves clean before the Passover.
</p></origin><translate id="div_54" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:55 犹太人的逾越节近了。有许多人从乡下上耶路撒冷去，要在节前洁净自己。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_55');"> <p>11:56 They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another while they were in the Temple, What is your opinion? Will he not come to the feast?
</p></origin><translate id="div_55" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:56 他们就寻找耶稣，站在殿里彼此说，你们的意思如何，他不来过节吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_56');"> <p>11:57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone had knowledge where he was, he was to give them word, so that they might take him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_56" onclick="disDiv(this);">11:57 那时，祭司长和法利赛人早已吩咐说，若有人知道耶稣在哪里，就要报明，好去拿他。
