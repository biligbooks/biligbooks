</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:5 使者又来说，便哈达如此说，我已差遣人去见你，要你将你的金银，妻子，儿女都给我。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>20:6 But I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, to make a search through your house and the houses of your people, and everything which is pleasing in your eyes they will take away in their hands.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>20:7 Then the king of Israel sent for all the responsible men of the land, and said, Now will you take note and see the evil purpose of this man: he sent for my wives and my children, my silver and my gold, and I did not keep them back.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:7 以色列王召了国中的长老来，对他们说，请你们看看，这人是怎样地谋害我，他先差遣人到我这里来，要我的妻子，儿女，和金银，我并没有推辞他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>20:8 And all the responsible men and the people said to him, Do not give attention to him or do what he says.

</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:9 故此，以色列王对便哈达的使者说，你们告诉我主我王说，王头一次差遣人向仆人所要的，仆人都依从。但这次所要的，我不能依从。使者就去回覆便哈达。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>20:10 Then Ben-hadad sent to him, saying, May the gods' punishment be on me if there is enough of the dust of Samaria for all the people at my feet to take some in their hands.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:10 便哈达又差遣人去见亚哈说，撒玛利亚的尘土若够跟从我的人每人捧一捧的，愿神明重重地降罚与我。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>20:11 And the king of Israel said in answer, Say to him, The time for loud talk is not when a man is putting on his arms, but when he is taking them off.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>20:12 Now when this answer was given to Ben-hadad, he was drinking with the kings in the tents, and he said to his men, Take up your positions. So they put themselves in position for attacking the town.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:12 便哈达和诸王正在帐幕里喝酒，听见这话，就对他臣仆说，摆队吧。他们就摆队攻城。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>20:13 Then a prophet came up to Ahab, king of Israel, and said, The Lord says, Have you seen all this great army? See, I will give it into your hands today, and you will see that I am the Lord.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:13 有一个先知来见以色列王亚哈，说，耶和华如此说，这一大群人你看见了吗？今日我必将他们交在你手里，你就知道我是耶和华。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>20:14 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, The Lord says, By the servants of the chiefs who are over the divisions of the land. Then he said, By whom is the fighting to be started? And he made answer, By you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:14 亚哈说，借着谁呢？他回答说，耶和华说，借着跟从省长的少年人。亚哈说，要谁率领呢？他说，要你亲自率领。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>20:15 Then he got together the servants of all the chiefs who were over the divisions of the land, two hundred and thirty-two of them; and after them, he got together all the people, all the children of Israel, seven thousand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:15 于是亚哈数点跟从省长的少年人，共有二百三十二名，后又数点以色列的众兵，共有七千名。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>20:16 And in the middle of the day they went out. But Ben-hadad was drinking in the tents with the thirty-two kings who were helping him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:16 午间，他们就出城。便哈达和帮助他的三十二个王正在帐幕里痛饮。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>20:17 And the servants of the chiefs who were over the divisions of the land went forward first; and when Ben-hadad sent out, they gave him the news, saying, Men have come out from Samaria.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:17 跟从省长的少年人先出城。便哈达差遣人去探望，他们回报说，有人从撒玛利亚出来了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>20:18 And he said, If they have come out for peace, take them living, and if they have come out for war, take them living.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:18 他说，他们若为讲和出来，要活捉他们。若为打仗出来，也要活捉他们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>20:19 So the servants of the chiefs of the divisions of the land went out of the town, with the army coming after them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:19 跟从省长的少年人出城，军兵跟随他们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>20:20 And every one of them put his man to death, and the Aramaeans went in flight with Israel after them; and Ben-hadad, king of Aram, got away safely on a horse with his horsemen.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:20 各人遇见敌人就杀。亚兰人逃跑，以色列人追赶他们。亚兰王便哈达骑着马和马兵一同逃跑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>20:21 And the king of Israel went out and took the horses and the war-carriages, and made great destruction among the Aramaeans.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:21 以色列王出城攻打车马，大大击杀亚兰人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>20:22 Then the prophet came up to the king of Israel, and said to him, Now make yourself strong, and take care what you do, or a year from now the king of Aram will come up against you again.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:22 那先知来见以色列王，对他说，你当自强，留心怎样防备。因为到明年这时候，亚兰王必上来攻击你。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>20:23 Then the king of Aram's servants said to him, Their god is a god of the hills; that is why they were stronger than we: but if we make an attack on them in the lowlands, we will certainly be stronger than they.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:23 亚兰王的臣仆对亚兰王说，以色列人的神是山神，所以他们胜过我们。但在平原与他们打仗，我们必定得胜。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>20:24 This is what you have to do: take away the kings from their positions, and put captains in their places;
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:24 王当这样行，把诸王革去，派军长代替他们，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>20:25 And get together another army like the one which came to destruction, horse for horse, and carriage for carriage; and let us make war on them in the lowlands, and certainly we will be stronger than they. And he gave ear to what they said, and did so.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:25 又照着王丧失军兵之数，再招募一军，马补马，车补车，我们在平原与他们打仗，必定得胜。王便听臣仆的话去行。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>20:26 So, a year later, Ben-hadad got the Aramaeans together and went up to Aphek to make war on Israel.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:26 次年，便哈达果然点齐亚兰人上亚弗去，要与以色列人打仗。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>20:27 And the children of Israel got themselves together, and food was made ready and they went against them; the tents of the children of Israel were like two little flocks of goats before them, but all the country was full of the Aramaeans.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:27 以色列人也点齐军兵，预备食物，迎着亚兰人出去，对着他们安营，好像两小群山羊羔。亚兰人却满了地面。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>20:28 And a man of God came up and said to the king of Israel, The Lord says, Because the Aramaeans have said, The Lord is a god of the hills and not of the valleys; I will give all this great army into your hands, and you will see that I am the Lord.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:28 有神人来见以色列王，说，耶和华如此说，亚兰人既说我耶和华是山神，不是平原的神，所以我必将这一大群人都交在你手中，你们就知道我是耶和华。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>20:29 Now the two armies kept their positions facing one another for seven days. And on the seventh day the fight was started; and the children of Israel put to the sword a hundred thousand Aramaean footmen in one day.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:29 以色列人与亚兰人相对安营七日，到第七日两军交战。那一日以色列人杀了亚兰人步兵十万，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>20:30 But the rest went in flight to Aphek, into the town, where a wall came down on the twenty-seven thousand who were still living. And Ben-hadad went in flight into the town, into an inner room.
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:30 其余的逃入亚弗城。城墙塌倒，压死剩下的二万七千人。便哈达也逃入城，藏在严密的屋子里。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>20:31 Then his servants said to him, It is said that the kings of Israel are full of mercy: let us then put on haircloth, and cords on our heads, and go to the king of Israel; it may be that he will give you your life.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:31 他的臣仆对他说，我们听说以色列王都是仁慈的王，现在我们不如腰束麻布，头套绳索，出去投降以色列王，或者他存留王的性命。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>20:32 So they put on haircloth, and cords on their heads, and came to the king of Israel and said, Your servant Ben-hadad says, Let me now keep my life. And he said, Is he still living? he is my brother.
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:32 于是他们腰束麻布，头套绳索，去见以色列王，说，王的仆人便哈达说，求王存留我的性命。亚哈说，他还活着吗？他是我的兄弟。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>20:33 Now the men took it as a sign, and quickly took up his words; and they said, Ben-hadad is your brother. Then he said, Go and get him. So Ben-hadad came out to him and he made him get up into his carriage.
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:33 这些人留心探出他的口气来，便急忙就着他的话说，便哈达是王的兄弟。王说，你们去请他来。便哈达出来见王，王就请他上车。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>20:34 And Ben-hadad said to him, The towns my father took from your father I will give back; and you may make streets for yourself in Damascus as my father did in Samaria. And as for me, at the price of this agreement you will let me go. So he made an agreement with him and let him go.
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:34 便哈达对王说，我父从你父那里所夺的城邑，我必归还。你可以在大马色立街市，像我父在撒玛利亚所立的一样。亚哈说，我照此立约，放你回去，就与他立约，放他去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"> <p>20:35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbour by the word of the Lord, Give me a wound. But the man would not.
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:35 有先知的一个门徒奉耶和华的命对他的同伴说，你打我吧。那人不肯打他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>20:36 Then he said to him, Because you have not given ear to the voice of the Lord, straight away when you have gone from me a lion will put you to death. And when he had gone, straight away a lion came rushing at him and put him to death.
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:36 他就对那人说，你既不听从耶和华的话，你一离开我，必有狮子咬死你。那人一离开他，果然遇见狮子，把他咬死了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"> <p>20:37 Then he came across another man, and said, Give me a wound. And the man gave him a blow wounding him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_36" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:37 先知的门徒又遇见一个人，对他说，你打我吧。那人就打他，将他打伤。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_37');"> <p>20:38 So the prophet went away, and pulling his head-band over his eyes to keep his face covered, took his place by the road waiting for the king.
</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:38 他就去了，用头巾蒙眼，改换面目，在路旁等候王。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_38');"> <p>20:39 And when the king went by, crying out to him he said, Your servant went out into the fight; and a man came out to me with another man and said, Keep this man: if by any chance he gets away, your life will be the price of his life, or you will have to give a talent of silver in payment.
</p></origin><translate id="div_38" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:39 王从那里经过，他向王呼叫说，仆人在阵上的时候，有人带了一个人来，对我说，你看守这人，若把他失了，你的性命必代替他的性命。不然，你必交出一他连得银子来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"> <p>20:40 But while your servant was turning this way and that, he was gone. Then the king of Israel said to him, You are responsible; you have given the decision against yourself.
</p></origin><translate id="div_39" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:40 仆人正在忙乱之间，那人就不见了。以色列王对他说，你自己定妥了，必照样判断你。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_40');"> <p>20:41 Then he quickly took the head-band from his eyes; and the king of Israel saw that he was one of the prophets.
</p></origin><translate id="div_40" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:41 他急忙除掉蒙眼的头巾，以色列王就认出他是一个先知。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_41');"> <p>20:42 And he said to him, These are the words of the Lord: Because you have let go from your hands the man whom I had put to the curse, your life will be taken for his life, and your people for his people.
</p></origin><translate id="div_41" onclick="disDiv(this);">20:42 他对王说，耶和华如此说，因你将我定要灭绝的人放去，你的命就必代替他的命，你的民也必代替他的民。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_42');"> <p>20:43 Then the king of Israel went back to his house, bitter and angry, and came to Samaria.
