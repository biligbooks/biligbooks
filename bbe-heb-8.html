</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>8:5 Being servants of that which is a copy and an image of the things in heaven, as Moses, when he was about to make the Tent, had special orders from God: for, See, he said, that you make everything like the design which you saw in the mountain.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:5 他们供奉的事，本是天上事的形状和影像，正如摩西将要造帐幕的时候，蒙神警戒他，说，你要谨慎，作各样的物件，都要照着在山上指示你的样式。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>8:6 But now his position as priest is higher. because through him God has made a better agreement with man, based on the giving of better things.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:6 如今耶稣所得的职任是更美的，正如他作更美之约的中保。这约原是凭更美之应许立的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>8:7 For if that first agreement had been as good as possible, there would have been no place for a second.

</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:9 不像我拉着他们祖宗的手，领他们出埃及的时候，与他们所立的约。因为他们不恒心守我的约，我也不理他们。这是主说的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>8:10 For this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days: I will put my laws into their minds, writing them in their hearts: and I will be their God, and they will be my people:
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:10 主又说，那些日子以后，我与以色列家所立的约乃是这样。我要将我的律法放在他们里面，写在他们心上，我要作他们的神，他们要作我的子民。
