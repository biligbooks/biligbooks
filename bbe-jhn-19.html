</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:6 祭司长和差役看见他，就喊着说，钉他十字架，钉他十字架。彼拉多说，你们自己把他钉十字架吧。我查不出他有什么罪来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>19:7 And the Jews made answer, We have a law, and by that law it is right for him to be put to death because he said he was the Son of God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:7 犹太人回答说，我们有律法，按那律法，他是该死的，因他以自己为神的儿子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>19:8 When this saying came to Pilate's ears his fear became greater;
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:8 彼拉多听见这话，越发害怕。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>19:9 And he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus, Where do you come from? But Jesus gave him no answer.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>19:11 Jesus gave this answer: You would have no power at all over me if it was not given to you by God; so that he who gave me up to you has the greater sin.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:11 耶稣回答说，若不是从上头赐给你的，你就毫无权柄办我。所以把我交给你的那人，罪更重了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>19:12 Hearing this, Pilate had a desire to let him go free, but the Jews said in a loud voice, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: everyone who makes himself a king goes against Caesar.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:12 从此彼拉多想要释放耶稣。无奈犹太人喊着说，你若释放这个人，就不是该撒的忠臣。（原文作朋友）凡以自己为王的，就是背叛该撒了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>19:13 So when these words came to Pilate's ear, he took Jesus out, seating himself in the judge's seat in a place named in Hebrew, Gabbatha, or the Stone Floor.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:13 彼拉多听见这话，就带耶稣出来，到了一个地方，名叫铺华石处，希伯来话叫厄巴大，就在那里坐堂。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>19:14 (It was the day when they made ready for the Passover; and it was about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, There is your King!

</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:15 他们喊着说，除掉他，除掉他，钉他在十字架上。彼拉多说，我可以把你们的王钉十字架吗？祭司长回答说，除了该撒，我们没有王。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>19:16 So then he gave him up to them to be put to death on the cross. And they took Jesus away;
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:16 于是彼拉多将耶稣交给他们去钉十字架。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>19:17 And he went out with his cross on him to the place which is named Dead Man's Head (in Hebrew, Golgotha):
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:17 他们就把耶稣带了去。耶稣背着自己的十字架出来，到了一个地方，名叫髑髅地，希伯来话叫各各他。

</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:19 彼拉多又用牌子写了一个名号，安在十字架上。写的是犹太人的王，拿撒勒人耶稣。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>19:20 The writing was seen by a number of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was put to death on the cross was near the town; and the writing was in Hebrew and Latin and Greek.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:20 有许多犹太人念这名号。因为耶稣被钉十字架的地方，与城相近，并且是用希伯来，罗马，希利尼，三样文字写的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>19:21 Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not put, The King of the Jews, but, He said, I am the King of the Jews.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:21 犹太人的祭司长，就对彼拉多说，不要写犹太人的王。要写他自己说我是犹太人的王。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>19:22 But Pilate made answer, What I have put in writing will not be changed.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:22 彼拉多说，我所写的，我已经写上了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>19:23 And when Jesus was nailed to the cross, the men of the army took his clothing, and made a division of it into four parts, to every man a part, and they took his coat: now the coat was without a join, made out of one bit of cloth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:23 兵丁既然将耶稣钉在十字架上，就拿他的衣服分为四分，每兵一分。又拿他的里衣。这件里衣，原来没有缝儿，是上下一片织成的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>19:24 So they said among themselves, Let this not be cut up, but let us put it to the decision of chance and see who gets it. (They did this so that the Writings might come true, which say, They made a distribution of my clothing among them, and my coat they put to the decision of chance.) This was what the men of the army did.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:24 他们就彼此说，我们不要撕开，只要拈阄，看谁得着。这要应验经上的话说，他们分了我的外衣，为我的里衣拈阄。兵丁果然作了这事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>19:25 Now by the side of the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister Mary, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:25 站在耶稣十字架旁边的，有他母亲，与他母亲的姊妹，并革罗吧的妻子马利亚，和抹大拉的马利亚。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>19:26 So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple who was dear to him, he said to his mother, Mother, there is your son!
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:26 耶稣见母亲和他所爱的那门徒站在旁边，就对他母亲说，母亲（原文作妇人），看你的儿子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>19:27 Then he said to the disciple, There is your mother! And from that hour the disciple took her to his house.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:27 又对那门徒说，看你的母亲。从此那门徒就接她到自己家里去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>19:28 After this, being conscious that all things had now been done so that the Writings might come true, Jesus said, Give me water.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:28 这事以后，耶稣知道各样的事已经成了，为要使经上的话应验，就说，我渴了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>19:29 Now there was a vessel ready, full of bitter wine, and they put a sponge full of it on a stick and put it to his mouth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:29 有一个器皿盛满了醋，放在那里。他们就拿海绒蘸满了醋，绑在牛膝草上，送到他口。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>19:30 So when Jesus had taken the wine he said, All is done. And with his head bent he gave up his spirit.
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:30 耶稣尝（原文作受）了那醋，就说，成了。便低下头，将灵魂交付神了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>19:31 Now it was the day of getting ready for the Passover, and so that the bodies might not be on the cross on the Sabbath (because the day of that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews made a request to Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:31 犹太人因这日是预备日，又因那安息日是个大日，就求彼拉多叫人打断他们的腿，把他们拿去，免得尸首当安息日留在十字架上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>19:32 So the men of the army came, and the legs of the first were broken and then of the other who was put to death on the cross with Jesus:
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:32 于是兵丁来，把头一个人的腿，并与耶稣同钉第二个人的腿，都打断了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>19:33 But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead by this time, and so his legs were not broken;
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:33 只是来到耶稣那里，见他已经死了，就不打断他的腿。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>19:34 But one of the men made a wound in his side with a spear, and straight away there came out blood and water.
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:34 惟有一个兵拿枪扎他的肋旁，随即有血和水流出来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"> <p>19:35 And he who saw it has given witness (and his witness is true; he is certain that what he says is true) so that you may have belief.
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:35 看见这事的那人就作见证，他的见证也是真的，并且他知道自己所说的是真的，叫你们也可以信。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>19:36 These things came about so that the Writings might be true, No bone of his body will be broken.
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:36 这些事成了，为要应验经上的话说，他的骨头，一根也不可折断。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"> <p>19:37 And again another verse says, They will see him who was wounded by their spears.
</p></origin><translate id="div_36" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:37 经上又有一句说，他们要仰望自己所扎的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_37');"> <p>19:38 After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, made a request to Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate said he might do so. So he went and took away his body.
</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:38 这些事以后，有亚利马太人约瑟，是耶稣的门徒，只因怕犹太人，就暗暗地作门徒，他来求彼拉多，要把耶稣的身体领去。彼拉多允准，他就把耶稣的身体领去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_38');"> <p>19:39 And Nicodemus came (he who had first come to Jesus by night) with a roll of myrrh and aloes mixed, about a hundred pounds.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"> <p>19:40 Then they took the body of Jesus, folding linen about it with the spices, as is the way of the Jews when they put the dead to rest.
</p></origin><translate id="div_39" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:40 他们就照犹太人殡葬的规矩，把耶稣的身体，用细麻布加上香料裹好了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_40');"> <p>19:41 Now there was a garden near the cross, and in the garden a new place for the dead in which no man had ever been put.
</p></origin><translate id="div_40" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:41 在耶稣钉十字架的地方，有一个园子。园子里有一座新坟墓，是从来没有葬过人的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_41');"> <p>19:42 So they put Jesus there, because it was the Jews' day of getting ready for the Passover, and the place was near.
</p></origin><translate id="div_41" onclick="disDiv(this);">19:42 只因是犹太人的预备日，又因那坟墓近，他们就把耶稣安放在那里。
