</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>2:5 For he did not make the angels rulers over the world to come, of which I am writing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:5 我们所说将来的世界，神原没有交给天使管辖。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>2:6 But a certain writer has given his witness, saying, What is man, that you keep him in mind? what is the son of man, that you take him into account?

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>2:11 For he who makes holy and those who are made holy are all of one family; and for this reason it is no shame for him to give them the name of brothers,
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:11 因那使人成圣的，和那些得以成圣的，都是出于一。所以他称他们为弟兄，也不以为耻，

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>2:17 Because of this it was necessary for him to be made like his brothers in every way, so that he might be a high priest full of mercy and keeping faith in everything to do with God, making offerings for the sins of the people.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:17 所以他凡事该与他的弟兄相同，为要在神的事上，成为慈悲忠信的大祭司，为百姓的罪献上挽回祭。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>2:18 For having been put to the test himself, he is able to give help to others when they are tested.
