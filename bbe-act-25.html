</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">25:23 第二天，亚基帕和百尼基大张威势而来，同着众千夫长，和城里的尊贵人，进了公厅。非斯都吩咐一声，就有人将保罗带进来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>25:24 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all those who are present here with us, you see this man, about whom all the Jews have made protests to me, at Jerusalem and in this place, saying that it is not right for him to be living any longer.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">25:24 非斯都说，亚基帕王，和在这里的诸位阿，你们看这人，就是一切犹太人在耶路撒冷，和这里，曾向我恳求，呼叫说，不可容他再活着。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>25:25 But, in my opinion, there is no cause of death in him, and as he himself has made a request to be judged by Caesar, I have said that I would send him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">25:25 但我查明他没有犯什么该死的罪。并且他自己上告于皇帝，所以我定意把他解去
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>25:26 But I have no certain account of him to send to Caesar. So I have sent for him to come before you, and specially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the business has been gone into, I may have something to put in writing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">25:26 论到这人，我没有确实的事，可以奏明主上。因此我带他到你们面前，也特意带他到你亚基帕王面前，为要在查问之后，有所陈奏。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>25:27 For it seems to me against reason to send a prisoner without making clear what there is against him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">25:27 据我看来，解送囚犯，不指明他的罪案，是不合理的。
