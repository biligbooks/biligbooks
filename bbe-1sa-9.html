</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>9:2 He had a son named Saul, a specially good-looking young man; there was no one better-looking among the children of Israel: he was taller by a head than any other of the people.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:2 他有一个儿子，名叫扫罗，又健壮，又俊美，在以色列人中没有一个能比他的。身体比众民高过一头。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>9:3 Now the asses of Saul's father Kish had gone wandering away. And Kish said to his son Saul, Take one of the servants with you, and get up and go in search of the asses.

</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:4 扫罗就走过以法莲山地，又过沙利沙地，都没有找着。又过沙琳地，驴也不在那里。又过便雅悯地，还没有找着。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>9:5 And when they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, Come, let us go back, or my father may give up caring about the asses and be troubled about us.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:5 到了苏弗地，扫罗对跟随他的仆人说，我们不如回去，恐怕我父亲不为驴挂心，反为我们担忧。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>9:6 But the servant said to him, See now, in this town there is a man of God, who is highly honoured, and everything he says comes true: let us go there now; it may be that he will give us directions about our journey.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:6 仆人说，这城里有一位神人，是众人所尊重的，凡他所说的全都应验。我们不如往他那里去，或者他能将我们当走的路指示我们。

</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:8 仆人回答扫罗说，我手里有银子一舍客勒的四分之一，可以送那神人，请他指示我们当走的路。

So go up now and you will see him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:13 在他还没有上丘坛吃祭物之先，你们一进城必遇见他。因他未到，百姓不能吃，必等他先祝祭，然后请的客才吃。现在你们上去，这时候必遇见他。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>9:17 And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him, This is the man of whom I gave you word! he it is who is to have authority over my people.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>9:18 Then Saul came up to Samuel in the doorway of the town and said, Give me directions, if you will be so good, to the house of the seer.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:18 扫罗在城门里走到撒母耳跟前，说，请告诉我，先见的寓所在哪里。

</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:19 撒母耳回答说，我就是先见。你在我前面上丘坛去，因为你们今日必与我同席。明日早晨我送你去，将你心里的事都告诉你。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>9:20 As for your asses which have been wandering for three days, give no thought to them, for they have come back. And for whom are all the desired things in Israel? are they not for you and your father's family?
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:20 至于你前三日所丢的那几头驴，你心里不必挂念，已经找着了。以色列众人所仰慕的是谁呢？不是仰慕你和你父的全家吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>9:21 And Saul said, Am I not a man of Benjamin, the smallest of all the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of the families of Benjamin? why then do you say these words to me?
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:21 扫罗说，我不是以色列支派中至小的便雅悯人吗？我家不是便雅悯支派中至小的家吗？你为何对我说这样的话呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>9:22 Then Samuel took Saul and his servant into the guest room, and made them take the chief place among all the guests who were there, about thirty persons.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:22 撒母耳领扫罗和他仆人进了客堂，使他们在请来的客中坐首位。客约有三十个人。

</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:23 撒母耳对厨役说，我交给你收存的那一分祭肉现在可以拿来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>9:24 And the cook took up the leg with the fat tail on it, and put it before Saul. And Samuel said, This is the part which has been kept for you: take it as your part of the feast; because it has been kept for you till the right time came and till the guests were present. So that day Saul took food with Samuel.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:24 厨役就把收存的腿拿来，摆在扫罗面前，撒母耳说，这是所留下的，放在你面前。吃吧。因我请百姓的时候，特意为你存留这肉到此时。当日，扫罗就与撒母耳同席。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>9:25 And when they had come down from the high place into the town, where a bed was made ready for Saul, he went to rest.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>9:26 And about dawn Samuel said to Saul on the roof, Get up so that I may send you away. So Saul got up, and he and Samuel went out together.
