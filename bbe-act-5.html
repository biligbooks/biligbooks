</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>5:2 And kept back part of the price, his wife having knowledge of it, and took the rest and put it at the feet of the Apostles.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why has the Evil One put it into your heart to be false to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:3 彼得说，亚拿尼亚为什么撒但充满了你的心，叫你欺哄圣灵，把田地的价银私自留下几分呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>5:4 While you had it, was it not your property? and after you had given it in exchange, was it not still in your power? how has this purpose come into your mind? you have been false, not to men, but to God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:4 田地还没有卖，不是你自己的吗？既卖了，价银不是你作主吗？你怎么心里起这意念呢？你不是欺哄人，是欺哄神了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>5:5 And at these words, Ananias went down on the earth, and his life went from him: and great fear came on all who were present.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:5 亚拿尼亚听见这话，就仆倒断了气。听见的人都甚惧怕。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>5:6 And the young men went and made ready his body, and took it out, and put it in the earth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:6 有些少年人起来，把他包裹抬出去埋葬了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>5:7 And about three hours after, his wife, having no knowledge of what had taken place, came in.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:7 约过了三小时，他的妻子进来，还不知道这事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>5:8 And Peter said to her, Give me an answer: was this amount of money the price of the land? And she said, Yes, it was.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:8 彼得对她说，你告诉我，你们卖田地的价银，就是这些吗？她说，就是这些。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>5:9 But Peter said to her, Why have you made an agreement together to be false to the Spirit of the Lord? See, the feet of the young men who have put the body of your husband in the earth, are at the door, and they will take you out.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:9 彼得说，你们为什么同心试探主的灵呢？埋葬你丈夫之人的脚，已到门口，他们也要把你抬出去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>5:10 And straight away she went down at his feet, and her life went from her: and the young men came in and saw her dead, and they took her out and put her in the earth with her husband.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:10 妇人立刻仆倒在彼得脚前，断了气。那些少年人进来，见她已经死了，就抬出去，埋在她丈夫旁边。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>5:11 Then great fear came on all the church and on all who had knowledge of these things.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:11 全教会，和听见这事的人，都甚惧怕。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>5:12 Now a number of signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the Apostles; and they were all together in Solomon's covered way.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:12 主借使徒的手，在民间行了许多神迹奇事，（他们（或作信的人）都同心合意地在所罗门的廊下。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>5:13 The others, in fear, kept back from joining them: but the people made much of them;
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:13 其余的人，没有一个敢贴近他们。百姓却尊重他们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>5:14 And a great number of men and women had faith, and were joined to the Lord;
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:14 信而归主的人越发增添，连男带女很多）。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>5:15 And they even took into the streets people who were ill, and put them on beds, so that when Peter went by, some of them might be in his shade.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:15 甚至有人将病人抬到街上，放在床上，或褥子上，指望彼得过来的时候，或者得他的影儿照在什么人身上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>5:16 And numbers of people came together from the towns round about Jerusalem, with those who were ill and those who were troubled with unclean spirits: and they were all made well.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:16 还有许多人，带着病人，和被污鬼缠磨的，从耶路撒冷四围的城邑来，全都得了医治。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>5:17 But the high priest and those who were with him (the Sadducees) were full of envy,
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:17 大祭司和他的一切同人，就是撒都该教门的人，都起来，满心忌恨。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>5:18 And they took the Apostles and put them in the common prison.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:18 就下手拿住使徒，收在外监。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>5:19 But in the night an angel of the Lord, opening the doors of the prison, took them out and said,
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:19 但主的使者，夜间开了监门，领他们出来，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>5:20 Go, take your place in the Temple and give the people all the teaching about this Life.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:20 说，你们去站在殿里，把这生命的道，都讲给百姓听。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>5:21 And hearing this, they went into the Temple at dawn, and were teaching. But the high priest and those who were with him got together the Sanhedrin and the representatives of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to get them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:21 使徒听了这话，天将亮的时候，就进殿里去教训人。大祭司和他的同人来了，叫齐公会的人，和以色列族的众长老，就差人到监里去，要把使徒提出来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>5:22 But the men who were sent saw that they were not in the prison, and came back with the news,
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:22 但差役到了，不见他们在监里，就回来禀报说，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>5:23 Saying, The doors of the prison were safely shut, and the keepers were at the doors, but when they were open, there was nobody inside.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:23 我们看见监牢关得极妥当，看守的人也站在门外，及至开了门，里面一个人都不见。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>5:24 Now, at these words, the captain of the Temple and the chief priests were greatly troubled about what might be the end of this business.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:24 守殿官和祭司长听见这话，心里犯难，不知这事将来如何。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>5:25 And someone came and said to them, The men, whom you put in prison, are in the Temple teaching the people.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:25 有一个人来禀报说，你们收在监里的人，现在站在殿里教训百姓。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>5:26 Then the captain and some of the police went and took them, but not violently, for fear that they might be stoned by the people.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:26 于是守殿官和差役去带使徒来，并没有用强暴。因为怕百姓用石头打他们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>5:27 And they took them into the Sanhedrin, and the high priest said to them,
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:27 带到了，便叫使徒站在公会前，大祭司问他们说，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>5:28 We gave you very clear orders not to give teaching in this name: and now Jerusalem is full of your teaching, and you are attempting to make us responsible for this man's death.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:28 我们不是严严地禁止你们，不可奉这名教训人吗？你们倒把你们的道理充满了耶路撒冷，想要叫这人的血归到我们身上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>5:29 But Peter and the Apostles, answering, said, We have to do the orders of God, not of man.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:29 彼得和众使徒回答说，顺从神，不顺从人，是应当的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>5:30 The God of our fathers gave Jesus back to life, whom you had put to death, hanging him on a tree.
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:30 你们挂在木头上杀害的耶稣，我们祖宗的神已经叫他复活。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>5:31 Him God has put on high at his right hand, as a Ruler and a Saviour, to give to Israel a change of heart and forgiveness of sins.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:31 神且用右手将他高举，（或作他就是神高举在自己的右边）叫他作君王，作救主，将悔改的心，和赦罪的恩，赐给以色列人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>5:32 And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who keep his laws.
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:32 我们为这事作见证。神赐给顺从之人的圣灵，也为这事作见证。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>5:33 But when these words came to their ears, they were cut to the heart, and had a mind to put them to death.
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:33 公会的人听见就极其恼怒，想要杀他们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>5:34 But one of the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a man of learning in the law, of whom all the people had a high opinion, got up and made a suggestion for the men to be put outside for a little time.
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:34 但有一个法利赛人，名叫迦玛列，是众百姓所敬重的教法师，在公会中站起来，吩咐人把使徒暂且带到外面去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"> <p>5:35 And he said to them, Men of Israel, take care what you do about these men.
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:35 就对众人说，以色列人哪，论到这些人，你们应当小心怎样办理。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>5:36 For before this there was Theudas, who said he was someone important, to whom about four hundred men gave their support: he was put to death, and his band was broken up and came to nothing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:36 从前丢大起来，自夸为大。附从他的人约有四百。他被杀后，附从他的全都散了，归于无有。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"> <p>5:37 After this man, there was Judas of Galilee, at the time of the numbering, and some of the people went after him: he was put to death, and all his supporters were put to flight.
</p></origin><translate id="div_36" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:37 此后报名上册的时候，又有加利利的犹大起来，引诱些百姓跟从他，他也灭亡，附从他的人也都四散了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_37');"> <p>5:38 And now I say to you, Do nothing to these men, but let them be: for if this teaching or this work is of men, it will come to nothing:
</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:38 现在我劝你们不要管这些人，任凭他们吧，他们所谋的，所行的，若是出于人，必要败坏。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_38');"> <p>5:39 But if it is of God, you will not be able to overcome them, and you are in danger of fighting against God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_38" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:39 若是出于神，你们就不能败坏他们。恐怕你们倒是攻击神了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"> <p>5:40 And he seemed to them to be right: and they sent for the Apostles, and, after having them whipped and giving them orders to give no teaching in the name of Jesus, they let them go.
</p></origin><translate id="div_39" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:40 公会的人听从了他，便叫使徒来，把他们打了，又吩咐他们不可奉耶稣的名讲道，就把他们释放了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_40');"> <p>5:41 So they went away from the Sanhedrin, happy to undergo shame for the Name.
</p></origin><translate id="div_40" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:41 他们离开公会，心里欢喜。因被算是配为这名受辱。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_41');"> <p>5:42 And every day, in the Temple and privately, they went on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.
</p></origin><translate id="div_41" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:42 他们就每日在殿里，在家里，不住地教训人，传耶稣是基督。
