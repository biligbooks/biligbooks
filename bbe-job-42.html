</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">42:3 谁用无知的言语，使你的旨意隐藏呢？我所说的，是我不明白的。这些事太奇妙，是我不知道的。

</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">42:6 因此我厌恶自己，（自己或作我的言语）在尘土和炉灰中懊悔。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>42:7 And it came about, after he had said these words to Job, that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, I am very angry with you and your two friends, because you have not said what is right about me, as my servant Job has.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">42:7 耶和华对约伯说话以后，就对提幔人以利法说，我的怒气向你和你两个朋友发作，因为你们议论我，不如我的仆人约伯说的是。
