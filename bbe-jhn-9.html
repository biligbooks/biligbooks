</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>9:2 And his disciples put a question to him, saying, Master, was it because of this man's sin, or the sin of his father and mother, that he has been blind from birth?
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:2 门徒问耶稣说，拉比，这人生来是瞎眼的，是谁犯了罪？是这人呢？是他父母呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>9:3 Jesus said in answer, It was not because of his sin, or because of his father's or mother's; it was so that the works of God might be seen openly in him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:3 耶稣回答说，也不是这人犯了罪，也不是他父母犯了罪，是要在他身上显出神的作为来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>9:4 While it is day we have to do the works of him who sent me: the night comes when no work may be done.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:4 趁着白日，我们必须作那差我来者的工。黑夜将到，就没有人能作工了。

</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:5 我在世上的时候，是世上的光。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>9:6 Having said these words, he put earth, mixed with water from his mouth, on the man's eyes,
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:6 耶稣说了这话，就吐唾沫在地上，用唾沫和泥抹在瞎子的眼睛上，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>9:7 And said to him, Go and make yourself clean in the bath of Siloam (the sense of the name is, Sent). So he went away and, after washing, came back able to see.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:7 对他说，你往西罗亚池子里去洗，（西罗亚翻出来，就是奉差遣）他去一洗，回头就看见了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>9:8 Then the neighbours and others who had seen him before in the street, with his hand out for money, said, Is not this the man who got money from people?
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:8 他的邻舍，和那素常见他是讨饭的，就说，这不是那从前坐着讨饭的人吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>9:9 Some said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am he.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:9 有人说，是他。又有人说，不是，却是像他。他自己说，是我。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>9:10 So they said to him, How then were your eyes made open?
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:10 他们对他说，你的眼睛是怎么开的呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>9:11 His answer was: The man who is named Jesus put earth mixed with water on my eyes, and said to me, Go and make yourself clean in Siloam: so I went away and, after washing, am now able to see.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:11 他回答说，有一个人名叫耶稣。他和泥抹我的眼睛，对我说，你往西罗亚池子去洗。我去一洗，就看见了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>9:12 And they said to him, Where is he? His answer was: I have no knowledge.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:12 他们说，那个人在哪里？他说，我不知道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>9:13 They took him before the Pharisees--this man who had been blind.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:13 他们把从前瞎眼的人，带到法利赛人那里。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>9:14 Now the day on which the earth was mixed by Jesus and the man's eyes were made open was the Sabbath.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>9:15 So the Pharisees put more questions to him about how his eyes had been made open. And he said to them, He put earth on my eyes, and I had a wash and am able to see.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:15 法利赛人也问他是怎么得看见的。瞎子对他们说，他把泥抹在我的眼睛上，我去一洗，就看见了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>9:16 Then some of the Pharisees said, That man has not come from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath. Others said, How is it possible for a sinner to do such signs? So there was a division among them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:16 法利赛人中有的说，这个人不是从神来的，因为他不守安息日。又有人说，一个罪人怎能行这样的神迹呢？他们就起了纷争。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>9:17 Again they said to the blind man, What have you to say about him for opening your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:17 他们又对瞎子说，他既然开了你的眼睛，你说他是怎样的人呢？他说，是个先知。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>9:18 Now the Jews had no belief in the statement that he had been blind and was now able to see, till they sent for the father and mother of the man whose eyes had been made open,
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:18 犹太人不信他从前是瞎眼，后来能看见的，等到叫了他的父母来，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>9:19 And put the question to them, saying, Is this your son, of whom you say that he was blind at birth? how is it then that he is now able to see?
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:19 问他们说，这是你们的儿子吗？你们说他生来是瞎眼的，如今怎么能看见了呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>9:20 In answer his father and mother said, We are certain that this is our son and that he was blind at birth:
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:20 他父母回答说，他是我们的儿子，生来就瞎眼，这是我们知道的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>9:21 But how it is he is now able to see, or who made his eyes open, we are not able to say: put the question to him; he is old enough to give an answer for himself.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:21 至于他如今怎么能看见，我们却不知道。是谁开了他的眼睛，我们也不知道。他已经成了人，你们问他吧。他自己必能说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>9:22 They said this because of their fear of the Jews: for the Jews had come to an agreement that if any man said that Jesus was the Christ he would be put out of the Synagogue.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:22 他父母说这话，是怕犹太人，因为犹太人已经商议定了，若有认耶稣是基督的，要把他赶出会堂。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>9:23 That was the reason why they said, He is old enough; put the question to him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:23 因此他父母说，他已经成了人，你们问他吧。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>9:24 So they sent a second time for the man who had been blind and they said to him, Give glory to God: it is clear to us that this man is a sinner.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:24 所以法利赛人第二次叫了那从前瞎眼的人来，对他说，你该将荣耀归给神。我们知道这人是个罪人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>9:25 He said in answer, I have no knowledge if he is a sinner or not, but one thing I am certain about; I was blind, and now I see.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:25 他说，他是个罪人不是，我不知道。有一件事我知道，从前我是眼瞎的，如今能看见了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>9:26 Then they said to him, What did he do to you? how did he give you the use of your eyes?
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:26 他们就问他说，他向你作什么？是怎么开了你的眼睛呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>9:27 His answer was: I have said it before, but your ears were shut: why would you have me say it again? is it your desire to become his disciples?
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:27 他回答说，我方才告诉你们，你们不听。为什么又要听呢？莫非你们也要作他的门徒吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>9:28 And they were angry with him and said, You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:28 他们就骂他说，你是他的门徒。我们是摩西的门徒。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>9:29 We are certain that God gave his word to Moses: but as for this man, we have no knowledge where he comes from.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:29 神对摩西说话，是我们知道的。只是这个人，我们不知道他从哪里来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>9:30 The man said in answer, Why, here is a strange thing! You have no knowledge where he comes from though he gave me the use of my eyes.
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:30 那人回答说，他开了我的眼睛，你们竟不知道他从哪里来，这真是奇怪。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>9:31 We have knowledge that God does not give ear to sinners, but if any man is a worshipper of God and does his pleasure, to him God's ears are open.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:31 我们知道神不听罪人。惟有敬奉神，遵行他旨意的，神才听他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>9:32 In all the years nobody has ever before seen the eyes of a man blind from birth made open.
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:32 从创世以来，未曾听见有人把生来是瞎子的眼睛开了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>9:33 If this man did not come from God he would be unable to do anything.
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:33 这人若不是从神来的，什么也不能作。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>9:34 Their answer was: You came to birth through sin; do you make yourself our teacher? And they put him out of the Synagogue.
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:34 他们回答说，你全然生在罪孽中，还要教训我们吗？于是把他赶出去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"> <p>9:35 It came to the ears of Jesus that they had put him out, and meeting him he said, Have you faith in the Son of man?
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:35 耶稣听说他们把他赶出去。后来遇见他，就说，你信神的儿子吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>9:36 He said in answer, And who is he, Lord? Say, so that I may have faith in him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:36 他回答说，主阿，谁是神的儿子，叫我信他呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"> <p>9:37 Jesus said to him, You have seen him; it is he who is talking to you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_36" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:37 耶稣说，你已经看见他，现在和你说话的就是他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_37');"> <p>9:38 And he said, Lord, I have faith. And he gave him worship.
</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:38 他说，主阿，我信。就拜耶稣。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_38');"> <p>9:39 And Jesus said, I came into this world to be a judge, so that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.
</p></origin><translate id="div_38" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:39 耶稣说，我为审判到这世上来，叫不能看见的，可以看见。能看见的，反瞎了眼。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"> <p>9:40 These words came to the ears of the Pharisees who were with him and they said to him, Are we, then, blind?
</p></origin><translate id="div_39" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:40 同他在那里的法利赛人，听见这话，就说，难道我们也瞎了眼吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_40');"> <p>9:41 Jesus said to them, If you were blind you would have no sin: but now that you say, We see; your sin is there still.
</p></origin><translate id="div_40" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:41 耶稣对他们说，你们若瞎了眼，就没有罪了。但如今你们说，我们能看见，所以你们的罪还在。
