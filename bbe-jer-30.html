</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>30:2 The Lord, the God of Israel, has said, Put down in a book all the words which I have said to you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">30:2 耶和华以色列的神如此说，你将我对你说过的一切话都写在书上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>30:3 For see, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will let the fate of my people Israel and Judah be changed, says the Lord: and I will make them come back to the land which I gave to their fathers, so that they may take it for their heritage.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">30:3 耶和华说，日子将到，我要使我的百姓以色列和犹大被掳的人归回。我也要使他们回到我所赐给他们列祖之地，他们就得这地为业。这是耶和华说的。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>30:5 This is what the Lord has said: A voice of shaking fear has come to our ears, of fear and not of peace.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">30:5 耶和华如此说，我们听见声音，是战抖惧怕而不平安的声音。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>30:6 Put the question and see if it is possible for a man to have birth-pains: why do I see every man with his hands gripping his sides, as a woman does when the pains of birth are on her, and all faces are turned green?
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">30:6 你们且访问看看，男人有产难吗？我怎么看见人人用手掐腰，像产难的妇人，脸面都变青了呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>30:7 Ha! for that day is so great that there is no day like it: it is the time of Jacob's trouble: but he will get salvation from it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">30:7 哀哉。那日为大，无日可比。这是雅各遭难的时候，但他必被救出来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>30:8 For it will come about on that day, says the Lord of armies, that his yoke will be broken off his neck, and his bands will be burst; and men of strange lands will no longer make use of him as their servant:
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">30:8 万军之耶和华说，到那日，我必从你颈项上折断仇敌的轭，扭开他的绳索。外邦人不得再使你作他们的奴仆。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>30:10 So have no fear, O Jacob, my servant, says the Lord; and do not be troubled, O Israel: for see, I will make you come back from far away, and your seed from the land where they are prisoners; and Jacob will come back, and will be quiet and at peace, and no one will give him cause for fear.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">30:10 故此，耶和华说，我的仆人雅各阿，不要惧怕。以色列阿，不要惊惶。因我要从远方拯救你，从被掳到之地拯救你的后裔。雅各必回来得享平靖安逸，无人使他害怕。

</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">30:14 你所亲爱的都忘记你，不来探问（或作理会）你。我因你的罪孽甚大，罪恶众多，曾用仇敌加的伤害伤害你，用残忍者的惩治惩治你。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>30:15 Why are you crying for help because of your wound? for your pain may never be taken away: because your evil-doing was so great and because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">30:15 你为何因损伤哀号呢？你的痛苦无法医治。我因你的罪孽甚大，罪恶众多，曾将这些加在你身上。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>30:17 For I will make you healthy again and I will make you well from your wounds, says the Lord; because they have given you the name of an outlaw, saying, It is Zion cared for by no man.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">30:17 耶和华说，我必使你痊愈，医好你的伤痕，都因人称你为被赶散的，说，这是锡安，无人来探问（或作理会）的。

</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">30:18 耶和华如此说，我必使雅各被掳去的帐棚归回，也必顾惜他的住处。城必建造在原旧的山冈。宫殿也照旧有人居住。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>30:20 And their children will be as they were in the old days, and the meeting of the people will have its place before me, and I will send punishment on all who are cruel to them.

</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">30:21 他们的君王必是属乎他们的。掌权的必从他们中间而出。我要使他就近我，他也要亲近我。不然，谁有胆量亲近我呢？这是耶和华说的。
