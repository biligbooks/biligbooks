</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:2 有一只亚大米田的船，要沿着亚西亚一带地方的海边走，我们就上了那船开行，有马其顿的帖撒罗尼迦人，亚里达古，和我们同去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>27:3 And on the day after, we came to Sidon; and Julius was kind to Paul, and let him go to see his friends and take a rest.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>27:4 And sailing again from there, we went on under cover of Cyprus, because the wind was against us.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:4 从那里又开船，因为风不顺，就贴着居比路背风岸行去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>27:5 And having gone across the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to Myra, in Lycia.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:5 过了基利家旁非利亚前面的海，就到了吕家的每拉。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>27:6 And there the captain came across a ship of Alexandria, sailing for Italy, and put us in it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:6 在那里百夫长遇见一只亚力山太的船，要往义大利去，便叫我们上了那船。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>27:7 And when we had gone on slowly for a long time, and had had hard work getting across to Cnidus, for the wind was against us, we went under cover of Crete, in the direction of Salmone;
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:7 一连多日，船行得慢，仅仅来到革尼土的对面。因为被风拦阻，就贴着革哩底背风岸，从撒摩尼对面行过。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>27:8 And sailing down the side of it, as well as we were able, we came to a certain place named Fair Havens, near which was the town of Lasea.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:8 我们沿岸行走，仅仅来到一个地方，名叫佳澳。离那里不远，有拉西亚城。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>27:9 And as a long time had gone by, and the journey was now full of danger, because it was late in the year, Paul put the position before them,
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:9 走的日子多了，已经过了禁食的节期，行船又危险，保罗就劝众人说，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>27:10 Saying, Friends, I see that this journey will be one of great damage and loss, not only to the goods and the ship, but to ourselves.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:10 众位，我看这次行船，不但货物和船要受伤损，大遭破坏，连我们的性命也难保。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>27:11 But the captain gave more attention to the master and the owner of the ship than to what Paul said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:11 但百夫长信从掌船的和船主，不信从保罗所说的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>27:12 And as the harbour was not a good one in which to be for the winter, the greater number of them were for going out to sea, in order, if possible, to put in for the winter at Phoenix, a harbour of Crete, looking to the north-east and south-east.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:12 且因在这海口过冬不便，船上的人，就多半说，不如开船离开这地方，或者能到非尼基过冬。非尼基是革哩底的一个海口，一面朝东北，一面朝东南。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>27:13 And when the south wind came softly, being of the opinion that their purpose might be effected, they let the ship go and went sailing down the side of Crete, very near to the land.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:13 这时微微起了南风，他们以为得意，就起了锚，贴近革哩底行去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>27:14 But after a little time, a very violent wind, named Euraquilo, came down from it with great force.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:14 不多几时，狂风从岛上扑下来，那风名叫友拉革罗。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>27:15 And when the ship got into the grip of it, and was not able to make headway into the wind, we gave way, and went before it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:15 船被风抓住，敌不住风，我们就任风刮去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>27:16 And, sailing near the side of a small island named Cauda, we were able, though it was hard work, to make the ship's boat safe:
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:16 贴着一个小岛的背风岸奔行，那岛名叫高大，在那里仅仅收住了小船。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>27:17 And having got it up, they put cords under and round the ship; but fearing that they might be pushed on to the Syrtis, they let down the sails and so went running before the wind.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:17 既然把小船拉上来，就用缆索捆绑船底。又恐怕在赛耳底沙滩上搁了浅，就落下篷来，任船飘去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>27:18 And, still fighting the storm with all our strength, the day after they made a start at getting the goods out of the ship;
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:18 我们被风浪逼得甚急，第二天众人就把货物抛在海里。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>27:19 And on the third day, they let all the sailing apparatus go over the side.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:19 到第三天，他们又亲手把船上的器具抛弃了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>27:20 And as we had not seen the sun or stars for a long time, and a great storm was on us, all hope of salvation was gone.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:20 太阳和星辰多日不显露，又有狂风大浪催逼，我们得救的指望就都绝了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>27:21 And when they had been without food for a long time, Paul got up among them and said, Friends, it would have been better if you had given attention to me and not gone sailing out from Crete, to undergo this damage and loss.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:21 众人多日没有吃什么，保罗就出来站在他们中间说，众位，你们本该听我的话，不离开革哩底，免得遭这样的伤损破坏。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>27:22 But now, I say to you, be of good heart, for there will be no loss of life, but only of the ship.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:22 现在我还劝你们放心。你们的性命，一个也不失丧，惟独失丧这船。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>27:23 For this night there came to my side an angel of the God who is my Master and whose servant I am,
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:23 因我所属所事奉的神，他的使者昨夜站在我旁边说，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>27:24 Saying, Have no fear, Paul, for you will come before Caesar, and God has given to you all those who are sailing with you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:24 保罗，不要害怕，你必定站在该撒面前。并且与你同船的人，神都赐给你了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>27:25 And so, O men, be of good heart, for I have faith in God that it will be as he said to me.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:25 所以众位可以放心，我信神，他怎样对我说，事情也要怎样成就。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>27:26 But we will be sent on to a certain island.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:26 只是我们必要撞在一个岛上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>27:27 But when the fourteenth day came, while we were going here and there in the Adriatic sea, about the middle of the night the sailors had an idea that they were getting near land;
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:27 到了第十四天夜间，船在亚底亚海，飘来飘去，约到半夜，水手以为渐近旱地，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>27:28 And they let down the lead, and saw that the sea was a hundred and twenty feet deep; and after a little time they did it again and it was ninety feet.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:28 就探深浅，探得有十二丈，稍往前行，又探深浅，探得有九丈。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>27:29 Then, fearing that by chance we might come on to the rocks, they let down four hooks from the back of the ship, and made prayers for the coming of day.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:29 恐怕撞在石头上，就从船尾抛下四个锚，盼望天亮。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>27:30 Then the sailors made attempts secretly to get away from the ship, letting down a boat as if they were about to put down hooks from the front of the ship;
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:30 水手想要逃出船去，把小船放在海里，假作要从船头抛锚的样子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>27:31 But Paul said to the captain and his men, If you do not keep these men in the ship, you will not be safe.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:31 保罗对百夫长和兵丁说，这些人若不等在船上，你们必不能得救。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>27:32 Then the armed men, cutting the cords of the boat, let her go.
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:32 于是兵丁砍断小船的绳子，由它飘去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>27:33 And when dawn was near, Paul gave them all orders to take food, saying, This is the fourteenth day you have been waiting and taking no food.
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:33 天渐亮的时候保罗劝众人都吃饭，说，你们悬望忍饿不吃什么，已经十四天了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>27:34 So I make request to you to take food; for this is for your salvation: not a hair from the head of any of you will come to destruction.
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:34 所以我劝你们吃饭，这是关乎你们救命的事。因为你们各人连一根头发，也不至于损坏。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"> <p>27:35 And when he had said this and had taken bread, he gave praise to God before them all, and took a meal of the broken bread.
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:35 保罗说了这话，就拿着饼，在众人面前祝谢了神，掰开吃。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>27:36 Then they all took heart and did the same.
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:36 于是他们都放下心，也就吃了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"> <p>27:37 And we were, in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six persons.
</p></origin><translate id="div_36" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:37 我们在船上的，共有二百七十六个人
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_37');"> <p>27:38 And when they had had enough food, they made the weight of the ship less, turning the grain out into the sea.
</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:38 他们吃饱了，就把船上的麦子，抛在海里，为要叫船轻一点。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_38');"> <p>27:39 And when it was day, they had no knowledge of the land, but they saw an inlet of the sea with a floor of sand, and they had the idea of driving the ship up on to it if possible.
</p></origin><translate id="div_38" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:39 到了天亮，他们不认识那地方，但见一个海湾，有岸可登，就商议能把船拢进去不能。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"> <p>27:40 So cutting away the hooks, and letting them go into the sea, and freeing the cords of the guiding-blades, and lifting up the sail to the wind, they went in the direction of the inlet.
</p></origin><translate id="div_39" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:40 于是砍断缆索，弃锚在海里，同时也松开舵绳，拉起头篷，顺着风向岸行去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_40');"> <p>27:41 And coming to a point between two seas, they got the ship to land; and the front part was fixed in the sand and not able to be moved, but the back part was broken by the force of the waves.
</p></origin><translate id="div_40" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:41 但遇着两水夹流的地方，就把船搁了浅。船头胶住不动，船尾被浪的猛力冲坏。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_41');"> <p>27:42 Then the armed men were for putting the prisoners to death, so that no one would get away by swimming.
</p></origin><translate id="div_41" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:42 兵丁的意思，要把囚犯杀了，恐怕有？？水脱逃的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_42');"> <p>27:43 But the captain, desiring to keep Paul safe, kept them from their purpose, and gave orders that those who had knowledge of swimming were to go off the ship and get first to land:
</p></origin><translate id="div_42" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:43 但百夫长要救保罗，不准他们任意而行，就吩咐会？？水的，跳下水去先上岸。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_43');"> <p>27:44 And the rest, some on boards and some on things from the ship. And so it came about that they all got safe to land.
</p></origin><translate id="div_43" onclick="disDiv(this);">27:44 其余的人，可以用板子，或船上的零碎东西上岸。这样众人都得了救上了岸。
