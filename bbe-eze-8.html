</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:5 神对我说，人子阿，你举目向北观看。我就举目向北观看，见祭坛门的北边在门口有这惹忌邪的偶像。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>8:6 And he said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing? even the very disgusting things which the children of Israel are doing here, causing me to go far away from my holy place? but you will see other most disgusting things.
