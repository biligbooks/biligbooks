</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>7:2 But because of the desires of the flesh, let every man have his wife, and every woman her husband.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:2 但要免淫乱的事，男子当各有自己的妻子，女子也当各有自己的丈夫。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>7:3 Let the husband give to the wife what is right; and let the wife do the same to the husband.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:3 丈夫当用合宜之分待妻子，妻子待丈夫也要如此。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>7:4 The wife has not power over her body, but the husband; and in the same way the husband has not power over his body, but the wife.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:4 妻子没有权柄主张自己的身子，乃在丈夫。丈夫也没有权柄主张自己的身子，乃在妻子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>7:5 Do not keep back from one another what is right, but only for a short time, and by agreement, so that you may give yourselves to prayer, and come together again; so that Satan may not get the better of you through your loss of self-control.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:5 夫妻不可彼此亏负，除非两相情愿，暂时分房，为要专心祷告方可，以后仍要同房，免得撒但趁着你们情不自禁，引诱你们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>7:6 But this I say as my opinion, and not as an order of the Lord.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:6 我说这话，原是准你们的，不是命你们的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>7:7 It is my desire that all men might be even as I am. But every man has the power of his special way of life given him by God, one in this way and one in that.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:7 我愿意众人像我一样。只是各人领受神的恩赐，一个是这样，一个是那样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>7:8 But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them to be even as I am.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:8 我对着没有嫁娶的和寡妇说，若他们常像我就好。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>7:9 But if they have not self-control let them get married; for married life is better than the burning of desire.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:9 倘若自己禁止不住，就可以嫁娶。与其欲火攻心，倒不如嫁娶为妙。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>7:10 But to the married I give orders, though not I but the Lord, that the wife may not go away from her husband
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:10 至于那已经嫁娶的，我吩咐他们，其实不是我吩咐，乃是主吩咐，说，妻子不可离开丈夫。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>7:11 (Or if she goes away from him, let her keep unmarried, or be united to her husband again); and that the husband may not go away from his wife.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:11 若是离开了，不可再嫁。或是仍同丈夫和好。丈夫也不可离弃妻子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>7:12 But to the rest I say, and not the Lord; If a brother has a wife who is not a Christian, and it is her desire to go on living with him, let him not go away from her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:12 我对其余的人说，不是主说，倘若某弟兄有不信的妻子，妻子也情愿和他同住，他就不要离弃妻子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>7:13 And if a woman has a husband who is not a Christian, and it is his desire to go on living with her, let her not go away from her husband.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>7:14 For the husband who has not faith is made holy through his Christian wife, and the wife who is not a Christian is made holy through the brother: if not, your children would be unholy, but now are they holy.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:14 因为不信的丈夫，就因着妻子成了圣洁。并且不信的妻子，就因着丈夫成了圣洁。（丈夫原文作弟兄）不然，你们的儿女就不洁净。但如今他们是圣洁的了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>7:15 But if the one who is not a Christian has a desire to go away, let it be so: the brother or the sister in such a position is not forced to do one thing or the other: but it is God's pleasure that we may be at peace with one another.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:15 倘若那不信的人要离去，就由他离去吧。无论是弟兄，是姐妹，遇着这样的事，都不必拘束。神召我们原是要我们和睦。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>7:16 For how may you be certain, O wife, that you will not be the cause of salvation to your husband? or you, O husband, that you may not do the same for your wife?
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:16 你这作妻子的，怎么知道不能救你的丈夫呢？你这作丈夫的，怎么知道不能救你的妻子呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>7:17 Only, as the Lord has given to a man, and as is the purpose of God for him, so let him go on living. And these are my orders for all the churches.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:17 只要照主所分给各人的，和神所召各人的而行。我吩咐各教会都是这样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>7:18 If any man who is a Christian has had circumcision, let him keep so; and if any man who is a Christian has not had circumcision, let him make no change.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:18 有人已受割礼蒙召呢，就不要废割礼。有人未受割礼蒙召呢，就不要受割礼。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>7:19 Circumcision is nothing, and its opposite is nothing, but only doing the orders of God is of value.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:19 受割礼算不得什么，不受割礼也算不得什么。只要守神的诫命就是了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>7:20 Let every man keep the position in which he has been placed by God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:20 各人蒙召的时候是什么身分，仍要守住这身分。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>7:21 If you were a servant when you became a Christian, let it not be a grief to you; but if you have a chance to become free, make use of it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:21 你是作奴隶蒙召的吗？不要因此忧虑。若能以自由，就求自由更好。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>7:22 For he who was a servant when he became a Christian is the Lord's free man; and he who was free when he became a Christian is the Lord's servant.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:22 因为作奴仆蒙召于主的，就是主所释放的人。作自由之人蒙召的，就是基督的奴仆。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>7:23 It is the Lord who has made payment for you: be not servants of men.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:23 你们是重价买来的。不要作人的奴仆。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>7:24 My brothers, let every man keep in that condition which is the purpose of God for him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:24 弟兄们，你们各人蒙召的时候是什么身分，仍要在神面前守住这身分。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>7:25 Now about virgins I have no orders from the Lord: but I give my opinion as one to whom the Lord has given mercy to be true to him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:25 论到童身的人，我没有主的命令，但我既蒙主怜恤，能作忠心的人，就把自己的意见告诉你们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>7:26 In my opinion then, because of the present trouble, it is good for a man to keep as he is.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:26 因现今的艰难，据我看来，人不如守素安常才好。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>7:27 If you are married to a wife, make no attempt to get free from her: if you are free from a wife, do not take a wife.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:27 你有妻子缠着呢，就不要求脱离。你没有妻子缠着呢，就不要求妻子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>7:28 If you get married it is not a sin; and if an unmarried woman gets married it is not a sin. But those who do so will have trouble in the flesh. But I will not be hard on you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:28 你若娶妻，并不是犯罪。处女若出嫁，也不是犯罪。然而这等人肉身必受苦难。我却愿意你们免这苦难。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>7:29 But I say this, my brothers, the time is short; and from now it will be wise for those who have wives to be as if they had them not;
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:29 弟兄们，我对你们说，时候减少了。从此以后，那有妻子的，要像没有妻子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>7:30 And for those who are in sorrow, to give no signs of it; and for those who are glad, to give no signs of joy; and for those who are getting property, to be as if they had nothing;
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:30 哀哭的，要像不哀哭。快乐的，要像不快乐。置买的，要像无有所得。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>7:31 And for those who make use of the world, not to be using it fully; for this world's way of life will quickly come to an end.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:31 用世物的，要像不用世物。因为这世界的样子将要过去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>7:32 But it is my desire for you to be free from cares. The unmarried man gives his mind to the things of the Lord, how he may give pleasure to the Lord:
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:32 我愿你们无所挂虑。没有娶妻的，是为主的事挂虑，想怎样叫主喜悦。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>7:33 But the married man gives his attention to the things of this world, how he may give pleasure to his wife.
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:33 娶了妻的，是为世上的事挂虑，想怎样叫妻子喜悦。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>7:34 And the wife is not the same as the virgin. The virgin gives her mind to the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy in body and in spirit: but the married woman takes thought for the things of the world, how she may give pleasure to her husband.
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:34 妇人和处女也有分别。没有出嫁的，是为主的事挂虑，要身体灵魂都圣洁。已经出嫁的，是为世上的事挂虑，想怎样叫丈夫喜悦。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"> <p>7:35 Now I say this for your profit; not to make things hard for you, but because of what is right, and so that you may be able to give all your attention to the things of the Lord.
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:35 我说这话，是为你们的益处。不是要牢笼你们，乃是要叫你们行合宜的事，得以殷勤服事主，没有分心的事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>7:36 But if, in any man's opinion, he is not doing what is right for his virgin, if she is past her best years, and there is need for it, let him do what seems right to him; it is no sin; let them be married.
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:36 若有人以为自己待他的女儿不合宜，女儿也过了年岁，事又当行，他就可随意办理，不算有罪，叫二人成亲就是了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"> <p>7:37 But the man who is strong in mind and purpose, who is not forced but has control over his desires, does well if he comes to the decision to keep her a virgin.
</p></origin><translate id="div_36" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:37 倘若人心里坚定，没有不得已的事，并且由得自己作主，心里又决定了留下女儿不出嫁，如此行也好。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_37');"> <p>7:38 So then, he who gets married to his virgin does well, and he who keeps her unmarried does better.
</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:38 这样看来，叫自己的女儿出嫁是好。不叫她出嫁更是好。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_38');"> <p>7:39 It is right for a wife to be with her husband as long as he is living; but when her husband is dead, she is free to be married to another; but only to a Christian.
</p></origin><translate id="div_38" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:39 丈夫活着的时候，妻子是被约束的。丈夫若死了，妻子就可以自由，随意再嫁。只是要嫁这在主里面的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"> <p>7:40 But it will be better for her to keep as she is, in my opinion: and it seems to me that I have the Spirit of God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_39" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:40 然而按我的意见，若常守节更有福气。我也想自己是被神的灵感动了。
