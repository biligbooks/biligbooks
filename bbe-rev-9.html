</p></origin><translate id="div_0" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:1 第五位天使吹号，我就看见一个星从天落到地上。有无底坑的钥匙赐给他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>9:2 And he made the great deep open and a smoke went up from it, like the smoke of a great oven; and the sun and the air were made dark because of the smoke.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:2 他开了无底坑，便有烟从坑里往上冒，好像大火炉的烟。日头和天空，都因这烟昏暗了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>9:3 And from the smoke locusts came out on the earth; and power was given them, like the power of scorpions.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:3 有蝗虫从烟中出来飞到地上。有能力赐给它们，好像地上蝎子的能力一样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>9:4 And they were ordered to do no damage to the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only to such men as have not the mark of God on their brows.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:4 并且吩咐它们说，不可伤害地上的草，和各样青物，并一切树木，惟独要伤害额上没有神印记的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>9:5 And orders were given them not to put them to death, but to give them great pain for five months: and their pain was as the pain from the wound of a scorpion.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:5 但不许蝗虫害死他们，只叫他们受痛苦五个月。这痛苦就像蝎子螫人的痛苦一样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>9:6 And in those days men will be hoping for death, and it will not come to them; and they will have a great desire for death, and death will go in flight from them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:6 在那些日子，人要求死，决不得死。愿意死，死却远避他们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>9:7 And the forms of the locusts were like horses made ready for war; and on their heads they had crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:7 蝗虫的形状，好像预备出战的马一样，头上戴的好像金冠冕，脸面好像男人的脸面。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>9:8 And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:8 头发像女人的头发，牙齿像狮子的牙齿。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>9:9 And they had breastplates like iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of carriages, like an army of horses rushing to the fight.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:9 胸前有甲，好像铁甲。它们翅膀的声音，好像许多车马奔跑上阵的声音。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>9:10 And they have pointed tails like scorpions; and in their tails is their power to give men wounds for five months.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:10 有尾巴像蝎子。尾巴上的毒钩能伤人五个月。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>9:11 They have over them as king the angel of the great deep: his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek language Apollyon.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:11 有无底坑的使者作它们的王。按着希伯来话，名叫亚巴顿，希利尼话，名叫亚玻伦。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>9:12 The first Trouble is past: see, there are still two Troubles to come.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:12 第一样灾祸过去了，还有两样灾祸要来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>9:13 And at the sounding of the sixth angel a voice came to my ears from the horns of the gold altar which is before God,
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:13 第六位天使吹号，我就听见有声音，从神面前金坛的四角出来，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>9:14 Saying to the sixth angel who had the horn, Make free the four angels who are chained at the great river Euphrates.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:14 吩咐那吹号的第六位天使，说，把那捆绑在伯拉大河的四个使者释放了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>9:15 And the four angels were made free, who were ready for the hour and day and month and year, that they might put to death a third part of men.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:15 那四个使者就被释放。他们原是预备好了，到某年某月某日某时，要杀人的三分之一。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>9:16 And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand: the number of them came to my ears.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:16 马军有二万万。他们的数目我听见了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>9:17 And so I saw the horses in the vision, and those who were seated on them, having breastplates of fire and glass and of burning stone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and a smell of burning.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:17 我在异象中看见那些马和骑马的，骑马的胸前有甲如火，与紫玛瑙，并硫磺。马的头好像狮子头，有火，有烟，有硫磺，从马的口中出来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>9:18 By these evils a third part of men was put to death, by the fire, and the smoke, and the burning smell which came out of their mouths.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:18 口中所出来的火，与烟，并硫磺，这三样灾杀了人的三分之一。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>9:19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails: because their tails are like snakes, and have heads, and with them they give wounds.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:19 这马的能力，是在口里，和尾巴上。因这尾巴像蛇，并且有头用以害人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>9:20 And the rest of the people, who were not put to death by these evils, were not turned from the works of their hands, but went on giving worship to evil spirits, and images of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood which have no power of seeing or hearing or walking:
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:20 其余未曾被这些灾所杀的人，仍旧不悔改自己手所作的，还是去拜鬼魔，和那些不能看，不能听，不能走，金，银，铜，木，石，的偶像。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>9:21 And they had no regret for putting men to death, or for their use of secret arts, or for the evil desires of the flesh, or for taking the property of others.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:21 又不悔改他们那些凶杀，邪术，奸淫，偷窃的事。
