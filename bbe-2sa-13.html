</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:4 他问暗嫩说，王的儿子阿，为何一天比一天瘦弱呢？请你告诉我。暗嫩回答说，我爱我兄弟押沙龙的妹子他玛。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>13:5 Then Jonadab said to him, Go to your bed, and let it seem that you are ill: and when your father comes to see you, say to him, Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread, and get the food ready before my eyes, so that I may see it and take it from her hand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:5 约拿达说，你不如躺在床上装病。你父亲来看你，就对他说，求父叫我妹子他玛来，在我眼前预备食物，递给我吃，使我看见，好从她手里接过来吃。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>13:6 So Amnon went to bed and made himself seem ill: and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let my sister Tamar come and make me one or two cakes before my eyes, so that I may take food from her hand.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:6 于是暗嫩躺卧装病。王来看他，他对王说，求父叫我妹子他玛来，在我眼前为我作两个饼，我好从她手里接过来吃。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>13:22 But Absalom said nothing to his brother Amnon, good or bad: for he was full of hate for him, because he had taken his sister Tamar by force.

</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">13:32 大卫的长兄，示米亚的儿子约拿达说，我主，不要以为王的众子少年人都杀了，只有暗嫩一个人死了。自从暗嫩玷辱押沙龙妹子他玛的那日，押沙龙就定意杀暗嫩了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>13:33 So now, let not my lord the king take this thing to heart, with the idea that all the king's sons are dead: for only Amnon is dead.

And the young man who kept the watch, lifting up his eyes, saw that a great band of people was coming down the slope by the way of the Horons; and the watchman came and gave word to the king, saying, I saw men coming down by the way of the Horons, from the hillside.
