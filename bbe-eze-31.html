</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">31:3 亚述王曾如利巴嫩中的香柏树，枝条荣美，影密如林，极其高大，树尖插入云中。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>31:4 It got strength from the waters and the deep made it tall: its streams went round about its planted land and it sent out its waterways to all the trees of the field.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">31:4 众水使它生长。深水使它长大。所栽之地有江河围流，汊出的水道延到田野诸树。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>31:5 In this way it became taller than all the trees of the field; and its branches were increased and its arms became long because of the great waters.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">31:5 所以它高大超过田野诸树。发旺的时候，枝子繁多，因得大水之力枝条长长。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>31:6 In its branches all the birds of heaven came to rest, and under its arms all the beasts of the field gave birth to their young, and great nations were living in its shade.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>31:8 No cedars were equal to it in the garden of God; the fir-trees were not like its branches, and plane-trees were as nothing in comparison with its arms; no tree in the garden of God was so beautiful.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">31:8 神园中的香柏树不能遮蔽它。松树不及它的枝子。枫树不及它的枝条。神园中的树都没有它荣美。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>31:16 I will send shaking on the nations at the sound of his fall, when I send him down to the underworld with those who go down into the deep: and on earth they will be comforting themselves, all the trees of Eden, the best of Lebanon, even all the watered ones.

This is Pharaoh and all his people, says the Lord.
