</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>2:5 Now there was a certain Jew in Shushan named Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>2:7 And he had been a father to Hadassah, that is Esther, the daughter of his father's brother: for she had no father or mother, and she was very beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his daughter.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:7 末底改抚养他叔叔的女儿哈大沙（后名以斯帖），因为她没有父母。这女子又容貌俊美，她父母死了，末底改就收她为自己的女儿。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>2:8 So when the order made by the king was publicly given out, and a number of girls had been placed in the care of Hegai in the king's house in Shushan, Esther was taken into the king's house and put in the care of Hegai, the keeper of the women.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:8 王的谕旨传出，就招聚许多女子到书珊城，交给掌管女子的希该。以斯帖也送入王宫，交付希该。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>2:9 And he was pleased with the girl and was kind to her; and he quickly gave her what was needed for making her clean, and the things which were hers by right, and seven servant-girls who were to be hers from the king's house: and he had her and her servant-girls moved to the best place in the women's part of the house.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:9 希该喜悦以斯帖，就恩待她。急忙给她需用的香品和她所当得的分，又派所当得的七个宫女服事她，使她和她的宫女搬入女院上好的房屋。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>2:10 Esther had not said what family or people she came from, for Mordecai had given her orders not to do so.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:10 以斯帖未曾将籍贯宗族告诉人，因为末底改嘱咐她不可叫人知道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>2:11 And every day Mordecai took his walk before the square of the women's house, to see how Esther was and what would be done to her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:11 末底改天天在女院前边行走，要知道以斯帖平安不平安，并后事如何。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>2:12 Now every girl, when her turn came, had to go in to King Ahasuerus, after undergoing, for a space of twelve months, what was ordered by the law for the women (for this was the time necessary for making them clean, that is, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet perfumes and such things as are needed for making women clean):
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:12 众女子照例先洁净身体十二个月。六个月用没药油，六个月用香料和洁身之物。满了日期，然后挨次进去见亚哈随鲁王。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>2:13 And in this way the girl went in to the king; whatever she had a desire for was given to her to take with her from the women's house into the house of the king.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:13 女子进去见王是这样。从女院到王宫的时候，凡她所要的都必给她。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>2:14 In the evening she went, and on the day after she came back to the second house of the women, into the keeping of Shaashgaz, one of the king's unsexed servants who had the care of the king's wives: only if the king had delight in her and sent for her by name did she go in to him again.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:14 晚上进去，次日回到女子第二院，交给掌管妃嫔的太监沙甲。除非王喜爱她，再提名召她，就不再进去见王。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>2:15 Now when the time came for Esther, the daughter of Abihail, his father's brother, whom Mordecai had taken as his daughter, to go in to the king, she made request for nothing but what Hegai, the king's servant and keeper of the women, had given her. And Esther was looked on kindly by all who saw her.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:15 末底改叔叔亚比孩的女儿，就是末底改收为自己女儿的以斯帖，按次序当进去见王的时候，除了掌管女子的太监希该所派定给她的，她别无所求。凡看见以斯帖的都喜悦她。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>2:16 So Esther was taken in to King Ahasuerus in his house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his rule.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:16 亚哈随鲁王第七年十月，就是提别月，以斯帖被引入宫见王。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>2:17 And Esther was more pleasing to the king than all the women, and to his eyes she was fairer and more full of grace than all the other virgins: so he put his crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:17 王爱以斯帖过于爱众女，她在王眼前蒙宠爱比众处女更甚。王就把王后的冠冕戴在她头上，立她为王后，代替瓦实提。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>2:18 Then the king gave a great feast for all his captains and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he gave orders through all the divisions of his kingdom for a day of rest from work, and gave wealth from his store.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:18 王因以斯帖的缘故给众首领和臣仆设摆大筵席，又豁免各省的租税，并照王的厚意大颁赏赐。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>2:19 And when the virgins came together in the second house of the women, Mordecai took his seat in the doorway of the king's house.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:19 第二次招聚处女的时候，末底改坐在朝门。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>2:20 Esther had still said nothing of her family or her people, as Mordecai had given her orders; for Esther did what Mordecai said, as when she was living with him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:20 以斯帖照着末底改所嘱咐的，还没有将籍贯宗族告诉人。因为以斯帖遵末底改的命，如抚养她的时候一样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>2:21 In those days, while Mordecai was seated at the king's doorway, two of the king's servants, Bigthan and Teresh, keepers of the door, being angry, were looking for a chance to make an attack on King Ahasuerus.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:21 当那时候，末底改坐在朝门，王的太监中有两个守门的，辟探和提列，恼恨亚哈随鲁王，想要下手害他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>2:22 And Mordecai, having knowledge of their purpose, sent word of it to Esther the queen; and Esther gave the news to the king in Mordecai's name.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:22 末底改知道了，就告诉王后以斯帖。以斯帖奉末底改的名，报告于王。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>2:23 And when the thing had been looked into, it was seen to be true, and the two of them were put to death by hanging on a tree: and it was put down in the records before the king.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:23 究察这事，果然是实，就把二人挂在木头上，将这事在王面前写于历史上。
