</p></origin><translate id="div_0" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:1 亲爱的弟兄阿，我们既有这等应许，就当洁净自己，除去身体灵魂一切的污秽，敬畏神，得以成圣。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>7:2 Let your hearts be open to us: we have done no man wrong, no man has been damaged by us, we have made no profit out of any man,
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:2 你们要心地宽大收纳我们。我们未曾亏负谁，未曾败坏谁，未曾占谁的便宜。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>7:3 It is not with the purpose of judging you that I say this: for I have said before that you are in our hearts for life and death together.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:3 我说这话，不是要定你们的罪。我已经说过，你们常在我们心里，情愿与你们同生同死。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>7:4 My words to you are without fear, I am full of pride on account of you: I have great comfort and joy in all our troubles.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:4 我大大地放胆向你们说话。我因你们多多夸口，满得安慰。我们在一切患难中分外的快乐。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>7:5 For even when we had come into Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; there were fightings outside and fears inside.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:5 我们从前就是到了马其顿的时候，身体也不得安宁，周围遭患难，外有争战，内有惧怕。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>7:6 But God who gives comfort to the poor in spirit gave us comfort by the coming of Titus;
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:6 但那安慰丧气之人的神，借着提多来安慰了我们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>7:7 And not by his coming only, but by the comfort which he had in you, while he gave us word of your desire, your sorrow, your care for me; so that I was still more glad.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:7 不但借着他来，也借着他从你们所得的安慰，安慰了我们。因他把你们的想念，哀恸，和向我的热心，都告诉了我，叫我更加欢喜。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>7:8 For though my letter gave you pain, I have no regret for it now, though I had before; for I see that the letter gave you pain, but only for a time.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:8 我先前写信叫你们忧愁。我后来虽然懊悔，如今却不懊悔。因我知道那信叫你们忧愁，不过是暂时的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>7:9 Now I am glad, not that you had sorrow, but that your sorrow was the cause of a change of heart; for yours was a holy sorrow so that you might undergo no loss by us in anything.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:9 如今我欢喜，不是因你们忧愁，是因你们从忧愁中生出懊悔来。你们依着神的意思忧愁，凡事就不至于因我们受亏损了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>7:10 For the sorrow which God gives is the cause of salvation through a change of heart, in which there is no reason for grief: but the sorrow of the world is a cause of death.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:10 因为依着神的意思忧愁，就生出没有后悔的懊悔来，以致得救。但世俗的忧愁，是叫人死。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>7:11 For you see what care was produced in you by this very sorrow of yours before God, what clearing of yourselves, what wrath against sin, what fear, what desire, what serious purpose, what punishment. In everything you have made it clear that you are free from sin in this business.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:11 你看，你们依着神的意思忧愁，从此就生出何等的殷勤，自诉，自恨，恐惧，想念，热心，责罚（或作自责），在这一切事上你们都表明自己是洁净的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>7:12 So though I sent you a letter, it was not only because of the man who did the wrong, or because of him to whom the wrong was done, but so that your true care for us might be made clear in the eyes of God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:12 我虽然从前写信给你们却不是为那亏负人的，也不是为那受人亏负的，乃要在神面前，把你们顾念我们的热心，表明出来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>7:13 So we have been comforted: and we had the greater joy in our comfort because of the joy of Titus, for his spirit had been made glad by you all.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:13 故此我们得了安慰，并且在安慰之中，因你们众人使提多心里畅快欢喜，我们就更加欢喜了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>7:14 For I was not put to shame in anything in which I may have made clear to him my pride in you; but as we said nothing to you but what was true, so the good things which I said to Titus about you were seen by him to be true.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:14 我若对提多夸奖了你们什么，也觉得没有惭愧。因我对提多夸奖你们的话，成了真的。正如我对你们所说的话，也都是真的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>7:15 And his love to you is the more increased by his memory of you all, how you gave way to his authority, and how you took him to your hearts with fear and honour.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:15 并且提多想起你们众人的顺服，是怎样恐惧战兢地接待他，他爱你们的心肠就越发热了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>7:16 It gives me great joy to see you answering to my good opinion of you in every way.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:16 我如今欢喜，能在凡事上为你们放心。
