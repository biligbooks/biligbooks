</p></origin><translate id="div_0" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:1 以色列阿，你当听。你今日要过约旦河，进去赶出比你强大的国民，得着广大坚固，高得顶天的城邑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>9:2 A people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, of whom you have knowledge and of whom it has been said, All are forced to give way before the sons of Anak.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:2 那民是亚衲族的人，又大又高，是你所知道的。也曾听见有人指着他们说，谁能在亚衲族人面前站立得住呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>9:3 Be certain then today that it is the Lord your God who goes over before you like an all-burning fire; he will send destruction on them, crushing them before you; and you will send them in flight, putting an end to them quickly, as the Lord has said.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:3 你今日当知道，耶和华你的神在你前面过去，如同烈火，要灭绝他们，将他们制伏在你面前。这样，你就要照耶和华所说的赶出他们，使他们速速灭亡。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>9:4 And after the Lord has sent them in flight from before you, say not in your heart, Because of my righteousness the Lord has given me this land; when it is because of their evil-doing that the Lord is driving these nations out before you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:4 耶和华你的神将这些国民从你面前撵出以后，你心里不可说，耶和华将我领进来得这地是因我的义。其实，耶和华将他们从你面前赶出去是因他们的恶。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>9:5 Not for your righteousness or because your hearts are upright are you going in to take their land; but because of the evil-doing of these nations the Lord your God is driving them out from before you, and to give effect to his oath to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:5 你进去得他们的地，并不是因你的义，也不是因你心里正直，乃是因这些国民的恶，耶和华你的神将他们从你面前赶出去，又因耶和华要坚定他向你列祖亚伯拉罕，以撒，雅各起誓所应许的话。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>9:6 Be certain then that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land as a reward for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:6 你当知道，耶和华你神将这美地赐你为业，并不是因你的义。你本是硬着颈项的百姓。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>9:7 Keep well in mind how you made the Lord your God angry in the waste land; from the day when you went out of Egypt till you came to this place, you have gone against the orders of the Lord.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:7 你当记念不忘，你在旷野怎样惹耶和华你神发怒。自从你出了埃及地的那日，直到你们来到这地方，你们时常悖逆耶和华。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>9:8 Again in Horeb you made the Lord angry, and in his wrath he would have put an end to you.

</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:12 对我说，你起来，赶快下去。因为你从埃及领出来的百姓已经败坏了自己。他们快快地偏离了我所吩咐的道，为自己铸成了偶像。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>9:18 And I went down on my face before the Lord, as at the first, for forty days and forty nights, without taking food or drinking water, because of all your sin, in doing evil in the eyes of the Lord and moving him to wrath.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:18 因你们所犯的一切罪，行了耶和华眼中看为恶的事，惹他发怒，我就像从前俯伏在耶和华面前四十昼夜，没有吃饭，也没有喝水。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>9:19 For I was full of fear because of the wrath of the Lord which was burning against you, with your destruction in view. But again the Lord's ear was open to my prayer.

</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:20 耶和华也向亚伦甚是发怒，要灭绝他。那时我又为亚伦祈祷。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>9:21 And I took your sin, the image which you had made, and put it in the fire and had it hammered and crushed very small till it was only dust: and the dust I put in the stream flowing down from the mountain.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">9:21 我把那叫你们犯罪所铸的牛犊用火焚烧，又捣碎磨得很细，以至细如灰尘，我就把这灰尘撒在从山上流下来的溪水中。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>9:25 So I went down on my face in prayer before the Lord for forty days and forty nights as I did at first; because the Lord had said that he would put an end to you.
