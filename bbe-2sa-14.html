</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:2 就打发人往提哥亚去，从那里叫了一个聪明的妇人来，对她说，请你假装居丧的，穿上孝衣，不要用膏抹身，要装作为死者许久悲哀的妇人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>14:3 And come to the king and say these words to him. So Joab gave her words to say.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:3 进去见王，对王如此如此说。于是约押将当说的话教导了妇人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>14:4 And the woman of Tekoa came to the king, and falling on her face, gave him honour and said, Give me help, O king.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>14:5 And the king said to her, What is your trouble? And her answer was, Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:5 王问她说，你有什么事呢？回答说，婢女实在是寡妇，我丈夫死了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>14:6 And I had two sons, and the two of them had a fight in the field, and there was no one to come between them, and one with a blow put the other to death.

</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:7 现在全家的人都起来攻击婢女，说，你将那打死兄弟的交出来，我们好治死他，偿他打死兄弟的命，灭绝那承受家业的。这样，他们要将我剩下的炭火灭尽，不与我丈夫留名留后在世上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>14:8 And the king said to the woman, Go to your house and I will give orders about this.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>14:10 And the king said, If anyone says anything to you, make him come to me, and he will do you no more damage.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:10 王说，凡难为你的，你就带他到我这里来，他必不再搅扰你。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>14:13 And the woman said, Why have you had such a thought about the people of God? (for in saying these very words the king has put himself in the wrong because he has not taken back the one whom he sent far away.)
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:13 妇人说，王为何也起意要害神的民呢？王不使那逃亡的人回来，王的这话就是自证己错了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>14:14 For death comes to us all, and we are like water drained out on the earth, which it is not possible to take up again; and God will not take away the life of the man whose purpose is that he who has been sent away may not be completely cut off from him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:14 我们都是必死的，如同水泼在地上，不能收回。神并不夺取人的性命，乃设法使逃亡的人不至成为赶出回不来的。

</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:15 我来将这话告诉我主我王，是因百姓使我惧怕。婢女想，不如将这话告诉王，或者王成就婢女所求的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>14:16 For the king will give ear, and take his servant out of the power of the man whose purpose is the destruction of me and my son together from the heritage of God.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>14:17 Then your servant said, May the word of my lord the king give me peace! for my lord the king is as the angel of God in his hearing of good and bad: and may the Lord your God be with you!
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:17 婢女又想，我主我王的话必安慰我。因为我主我王能辨别是非，如同神的使者一样。惟愿耶和华你的神与你同在。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>14:18 Then the king said to the woman, Now give me an answer to the question I am going to put to you; keep nothing back. And the woman said, Let my lord the king say on.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:18 王对妇人说，我要问你一句话，你一点不要瞒我。妇人说，愿我主我王说。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>14:19 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this? And the woman in answer said, By the life of your soul, my lord the king, it is not possible for anyone to go to the right hand or to the left from anything said by the king: your servant Joab gave me orders, and put all these words in my mouth:
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:19 王说，你这些话莫非是约押的主意吗？妇人说，我敢在我主我王面前起誓，王的话正对，不偏左右，是王的仆人约押吩咐我的，这些话是他教导我的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>14:20 This he did, hoping that the face of this business might be changed: and my lord is wise, with the wisdom of the angel of God, having knowledge of everything on earth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:20 王的仆人约押如此行，为要挽回这事。我主的智慧却如神使者的智慧，能知世上一切事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>14:21 And the king said to Joab, See now, I will do this thing: go then and Come back with the young man Absalom.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:21 王对约押说，我应允你这事。你可以去，把那少年人押沙龙带回来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>14:22 Then Joab, falling down on his face on the earth, gave the king honour and blessing; and Joab said, Today it is clear to your servant that I have grace in your eyes, my lord king, because the king has given effect to the request of his servant.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:22 约押就面伏于地叩拜，祝谢于王，又说，王既应允仆人所求的，仆人今日知道在我主我王眼前蒙恩了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>14:23 So Joab got up and went to Geshur and came back again to Jerusalem with Absalom.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:23 于是约押起身往基述去，将押沙龙带回耶路撒冷。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>14:24 And the king said, Let him go to his house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom went back to his house and did not see the face of the king.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:24 王说，使他回自己家里去，不要见我的面。押沙龙就回自己家里去，没有见王的面。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>14:25 Now in all Israel there was no one so greatly to be praised for his beautiful form as Absalom: from his feet to the crown of his head he was completely beautiful.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:25 以色列全地之中，无人像押沙龙那样俊美，得人的称赞，从脚底到头顶毫无瑕疵。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>14:26 And when he had his hair cut, (which he did at the end of every year, because of the weight of his hair;) the weight of the hair was two hundred shekels by the king's weight.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:26 他的头发甚重，每到年底剪发一次。所剪下来的，按王的平称一称，重二百舍客勒。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>14:27 And Absalom was the father of three sons and of one daughter named Tamar, who was very beautiful.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:27 押沙龙生了三个儿子，一个女儿。女儿名叫他玛，是个容貌俊美的女子。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>14:28 For two full years Absalom was living in Jerusalem without ever seeing the face of the king.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:28 押沙龙住在耶路撒冷足有二年，没有见王的面。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>14:29 Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king, but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:29 押沙龙打发人去叫约押来，要托他去见王，约押却不肯来。第二次打发人去叫他，他仍不肯来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>14:30 So he said to his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he has barley in it; go and put it on fire. And Absalom's servants put the field on fire.
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:30 所以押沙龙对仆人说，你们看，约押有一块田，与我的田相近，其中有大麦，你们去放火烧了。押沙龙的仆人就去放火烧了那田。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>14:31 Then Joab came to Absalom in his house and said to him, Why have your servants put my field on fire?
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:31 于是约押起来，到了押沙龙家里，问他说，你的仆人为何放火烧了我的田呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>14:32 And Absalom's answer was, See, I sent to you saying, Come here, so that I may send you to the king to say, Why have I come back from Geshur? it would be better for me to be there still: let me now see the king's face, and if there is any sin in me, let him put me to death.
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:32 押沙龙回答约押说，我打发人去请你来，好托你去见王，替我说，我为何从基述回来呢？不如仍在那里。现在要许我见王的面。我若有罪，任凭王杀我就是了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>14:33 So Joab went to the king and said these words to him: and when the king had sent for him, Absalom came, and went down on his face on the earth before the king: and the king gave him a kiss.
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">14:33 于是约押去见王，将这话奏告王，王便叫押沙龙来。押沙龙来见王，在王面前俯伏于地，王就与押沙龙亲嘴。
