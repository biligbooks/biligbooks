And Ziba said, The asses are for the use of the king's people, and the bread and the fruit are food for the young men; and the wine is for drink for those who are overcome by weariness in the waste land.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">16:2 王问洗巴说，你带这些来是什么意思呢？洗巴说，驴是给王的家眷骑的。面饼和夏天的果饼是给少年人吃的。酒是给在旷野疲乏人喝的。
