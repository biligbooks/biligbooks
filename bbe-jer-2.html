</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>2:3 Israel was holy to the Lord, the first-fruits of his increase: all who made attacks on him were judged as wrongdoers, evil came on them, says the Lord.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:3 那时以色列归耶和华为圣，作为土产初熟的果子。凡吞吃它的必算为有罪，灾祸必临到他们。这是耶和华说的。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>2:7 And I took you into a fertile land, where you were living on its fruit and its wealth; but when you came in, you made my land unclean, and made my heritage a disgusting thing.
