<origin onclick="showDiv('div_0');"> <p>7:1 In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream, and visions came into his head on his bed: then he put the dream in writing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_0" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:1 巴比伦王伯沙撒元年，但以理在床上作梦，见了脑中的异象，就记录这梦，述说其中的大意。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>7:2 I had a vision by night, and saw the four winds of heaven violently moving the great sea.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:2 但以理说，我夜里见异象，看见天的四风陡起，刮在大海之上。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>7:3 And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:3 有四个大兽从海中上来，形状各有不同，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>7:4 The first was like a lion and had eagle's wings; while I was watching its wings were pulled off, and it was lifted up from the earth and placed on two feet like a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:4 头一个像狮子，有鹰的翅膀。我正观看的时候，兽的翅膀被拔去，兽从地上得立起来，用两脚站立，像人一样，又得了人心。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>7:5 And I saw another beast, like a bear, and it was lifted up on one side, and three side-bones were in its mouth, between its teeth: and they said to it, Up! take much flesh.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:5 又有一兽如熊，就是第二兽，旁跨而坐，口齿内衔着三根肋骨。有吩咐这兽的说，起来吞吃多肉。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>7:6 After this I saw another beast, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings like those of a bird; and the beast had four heads, and the power of a ruler was given to it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:6 此后我观看，又有一兽如豹，背上有鸟的四个翅膀。这兽有四个头，又得了权柄。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>7:7 After this, in my vision of the night, I saw a fourth beast, a thing causing fear and very troubling, full of power and very strong; and it had great iron teeth: it took its food, crushing some of it to bits and stamping down the rest with its feet: it was different from all the beasts before it; and it had ten horns.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:7 其后我在夜间的异象中观看，见第四兽甚是可怕，极其强壮，大有力量，有大铁牙，吞吃嚼碎，所剩下的用脚践踏。这兽与前三兽大不相同，头有十角。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>7:8 I was watching the horns with care, and I saw another coming up among them, a little one, before which three of the first horns were pulled up by the roots: and there were eyes like a man's eyes in this horn, and a mouth saying great things.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:8 我正观看这些角，见其中又长起一个小角。先前的角中有三角在这角前，连根被它拔出来。这角有眼，像人的眼，有口说夸大的话。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>7:9 I went on looking till the seats of kings were placed, and one like a very old man took his seat: his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head was like clean wool; his seat was flames of fire and its wheels burning fire.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:9 我观看，见有宝座设立，上头坐着亘古常在者。他的衣服洁白如雪，头发如纯净的羊毛。宝座乃火焰，其轮乃烈火。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>7:10 A stream of fire was flowing and coming out from before him: a thousand thousands were his servants, and ten thousand times ten thousand were in their places before him: the judge was seated and the books were open.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:10 从他面前有火，像河发出。事奉他的有千千，在他面前侍立的有万万。他坐着要行审判，案卷都展开了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>7:11 Then I saw--because of the voice of the great words which the horn said--I saw till the beast was put to death, and its body was given to destruction, and the beast was given to the burning of fire.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:11 那时我观看，见那兽因小角说夸大话的声音被杀，身体损坏，扔在火中焚烧。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>7:12 As for the rest of the beasts, their authority was taken away: but they let them go on living for a measure of time.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:12 其余的兽，权柄都被夺去，生命却仍存留，直到所定的时候和日期。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>7:13 I saw in visions of the night, and there was coming with the clouds of heaven one like a man, and he came to the one who was very old, and they took him near before him.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:13 我在夜间的异象中观看，见有一位像人子的，驾着天云而来，被领到亘古常在者面前，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>7:14 And to him was given authority and glory and a kingdom; and all peoples, nations, and languages were his servants: his authority is an eternal authority which will not come to an end, and his kingdom is one which will not come to destruction.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:14 得了权柄，荣耀，国度，使各方，各国，各族的人都事奉他。他的权柄是永远的，不能废去。他的国必不败坏。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>7:15 As for me, Daniel, my spirit was pained because of this, and the visions of my head were troubling me.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:15 至于我但以理，我的灵在我里面愁烦，我脑中的异象使我惊惶。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>7:16 I came near to one of those who were waiting there, questioning him about what all this was. And he said to me that he would make clear to me the sense of these things.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:16 我就近一位侍立者，问他这一切的真情。他就告诉我，将那事的讲解给我说明。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>7:17 These great beasts are four kings who will be cut off from the earth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:17 这四个大兽就是四王将要在世上兴起。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>7:18 But the saints of the Most High will take the kingdom, and it will be theirs for ever, even for ever and ever.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:18 然而，至高者的圣民，必要得国享受，直到永永远远。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>7:19 Then it was my desire to have certain knowledge about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, a cause of great fear, whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass; who took his food, crushing some of it to bits and stamping on the rest with his feet;
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:19 那时我愿知道第四兽的真情，它为何与那三兽的真情大不相同，甚是可怕，有铁牙铜爪，吞吃嚼碎，所剩下的用脚践踏。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>7:20 And about the ten horns on his head and the other which came up, causing the fall of three; that horn which had eyes, and a mouth saying great things, which seemed to be greater than the other horns.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:20 头有十角和那另长的一角，在这角前有三角被它打落。这角有眼，有说夸大话的口，形状强横，过于它的同类。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>7:21 And I saw how that horn made war on the saints and overcame them,
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:21 我观看，见这角与圣民争战，胜了他们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>7:22 Till he came, who was very old, and the decision was made and the authority was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came when the saints took the kingdom.
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:22 直到亘古常在者来给至高者的圣民伸冤，圣民得国的时候就到了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>7:23 This is what he said: The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom which will come on earth, different from all the kingdoms, and it will overcome all the earth, crushing it down and smashing it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:23 那侍立者这样说，第四兽就是世上必有的第四国，与一切国大不相同，必吞吃全地，并且践踏嚼碎。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>7:24 And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will come to power; and after them another will come up: he will be different from the first ones and will put down three kings.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:24 至于那十角，就是从这国中必兴起的十王，后来又兴起一王，与先前的不同。他必制伏三王。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>7:25 And he will say words against the Most High, attempting to put an end to the saints of the Most High; and he will have the idea of changing times and law; and the saints will be given into his hands for a time and times and half a time.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:25 他必向至高者说夸大的话，必折磨至高者的圣民，必想改变节期和律法。圣民必交付他手一载，二载，半载。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>7:26 But the judge will be seated, and they will put an end to his authority, to overcome it and send complete destruction on it.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:26 然而，审判者必坐着行审判。他的权柄必被夺去，毁坏，灭绝，一直到底。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>7:27 And the kingdom and the authority and the power of the kingdoms under all the heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and all powers will be his servants and do his pleasure.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:27 国度，权柄，和天下诸国的大权必赐给至高者的圣民。他的国是永远的。一切掌权的都必事奉他，顺从他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>7:28 Here is the end of the account. As for me, Daniel, I was greatly troubled by my thoughts, and the colour went from my face: but I kept the thing in my heart.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:28 那事至此完毕。至于我但以理，心中甚是惊惶，脸色也改变了，却将那事存记在心。
