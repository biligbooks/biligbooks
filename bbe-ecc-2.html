</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>2:2 Of laughing I said, It is foolish; and of joy--What use is it?
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:2 我指嬉笑说，这是狂妄。论喜乐说，有何功效呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>2:3 I made a search with my heart to give pleasure to my flesh with wine, still guiding my heart with wisdom, and to go after foolish things, so that I might see what was good for the sons of men to do under the heavens all the days of their life.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:3 我心里察究，如何用酒使我肉体舒畅，我心却仍以智慧引导我。又如何持住愚昧，等我看明世人，在天下一生当行何事为美。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>2:4 I undertook great works, building myself houses and planting vine-gardens.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:4 我为自己动大工程，建造房屋，栽种葡萄园，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>2:5 I made myself gardens and fruit gardens, planting in them fruit-trees of all sorts.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:5 修造园囿，在其中栽种各样果木树，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>2:6 I made pools to give water for the woods with their young trees.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:6 挖造水池，用以浇灌嫩小的树木。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>2:7 I got men-servants and women-servants, and they gave birth to sons and daughters in my house. I had great wealth of herds and flocks, more than all who were in Jerusalem before me.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:7 我买了仆婢，也有生在家中的仆婢。又有许多牛群羊群，胜过以前在耶路撒冷众人所有的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>2:8 I got together silver and gold and the wealth of kings and of countries. I got makers of song, male and female; and the delights of the sons of men--girls of all sorts to be my brides.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:8 我又为自己积蓄金银，和君王的财宝，并各省的财宝。又得唱歌的男女，和世人所喜爱的物，并许多的妃嫔。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>2:9 And I became great; increasing more than all who had been before me in Jerusalem, and my wisdom was still with me.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:9 这样，我就日见昌盛，胜过以前在耶路撒冷的众人。我的智慧仍然存留。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>2:10 And nothing which was desired by my eyes did I keep from them; I did not keep any joy from my heart, because my heart took pleasure in all my work, and this was my reward.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:10 凡我眼所求的，我没有留下不给他的。我心所乐的，我没有禁止不享受的。因我的心为我一切所劳碌的快乐。这就是我从劳碌中所得的分。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>2:11 Then I saw all the works which my hands had made, and everything I had been working to do; and I saw that all was to no purpose and desire for wind, and there was no profit under the sun.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:11 后来我察看我手所经营的一切事，和我劳碌所成的功。谁知都是虚空，都是捕风，在日光之下毫无益处。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>2:12 And I went again in search of wisdom and of foolish ways. What may the man do who comes after the king? The thing which he has done before.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:12 我转念观看智慧，狂妄，和愚昧。在王以后而来的人，还能作什么呢？也不过行早先所行的就是了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>2:13 Then I saw that wisdom is better than foolish ways--as the light is better than the dark.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:13 我便看出智慧胜过愚昧，如同光明胜过黑暗。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>2:14 The wise man's eyes are in his head, but the foolish man goes walking in the dark; but still I saw that the same event comes to them all.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>2:15 Then said I in my heart: As it comes to the foolish man, so will it come to me; so why have I been wise overmuch? Then I said in my heart: This again is to no purpose.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:15 我就心里说，愚昧人所遇见的，我也必遇见。我为何更有智慧呢？我心里说，这也是虚空。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>2:16 Of the wise man, as of the foolish man, there is no memory for ever, seeing that those who now are will have gone from memory in the days to come. See how death comes to the wise as to the foolish!
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:16 智慧人，和愚昧人一样，永远无人记念。因为日后都被忘记。可叹智慧人死亡，与愚昧人无异。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>2:17 So I was hating life, because everything under the sun was evil to me: all is to no purpose and desire for wind.
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:17 我所以恨恶生命，因为在日光之下所行的事我都以为烦恼。都是虚空，都是捕风。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>2:18 Hate had I for all my work which I had done, because the man who comes after me will have its fruits.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:18 我恨恶一切的劳碌，就是我在日光之下的劳碌。因为我得来的必留给我以后的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>2:19 And who is to say if that man will be wise or foolish? But he will have power over all my work which I have done and in which I have been wise under the sun. This again is to no purpose.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:19 那人是智慧，是愚昧，谁能知道。他竟要管理我劳碌所得的，就是我在日光之下用智慧所得的。这也是虚空。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>2:20 So my mind was turned to grief for all the trouble I had taken and all my wisdom under the sun.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:20 故此，我转想我在日光之下所劳碌的一切工作，心便绝望。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>2:21 Because there is a man whose work has been done with wisdom, with knowledge, and with an expert hand; but one who has done nothing for it will have it for his heritage. This again is to no purpose and a great evil.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:21 因为有人用智慧知识灵巧所劳碌得来的，却要留给未曾劳碌的人为分。这也是虚空，也是大患。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>2:22 What does a man get for all his work, and for the weight of care with which he has done his work under the sun?
</p></origin><translate id="div_21" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:22 人在日光之下劳碌累心，在他一切的劳碌上得着什么呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>2:23 All his days are sorrow, and his work is full of grief. Even in the night his heart has no rest. This again is to no purpose.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:23 因为他日日忧虑，他的劳苦成为愁烦。连夜间心也不安。这也是虚空。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>2:24 There is nothing better for a man than taking meat and drink, and having delight in his work. This again I saw was from the hand of God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:24 人莫强如吃喝，且在劳碌中享福。我看这也是出于神的手。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>2:25 Who may take food or have pleasure without him?
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:25 论到吃用，享福，谁能胜过我呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>2:26 To the man with whom he is pleased, God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy; but to the sinner he gives the work of getting goods together and storing up wealth, to give to him in whom God has pleasure. This again is to no purpose and desire for wind.
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:26 神喜悦谁，就给谁智慧，知识，和喜乐。惟有罪人，神使他劳苦，叫他将所收聚的，所堆积的，归给神所喜悦的人。这也是虚空，也是捕风。
