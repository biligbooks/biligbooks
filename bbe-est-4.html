</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>4:2 And he came even before the king's doorway; for no one might come inside the king's door clothed in haircloth.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>4:3 And in every part of the kingdom, wherever the king's word and his order came, there was great sorrow among the Jews, and weeping and crying and going without food; and numbers of them were stretched on the earth covered with dust and haircloth.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:3 王的谕旨所到的各省各处，犹大人大大悲哀，禁食哭泣哀号，穿麻衣躺在灰中的甚多。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>4:4 And Esther's women and her servants came and gave her word of it. Then great was the grief of the queen: and she sent robes for Mordecai, so that his clothing of haircloth might be taken off; but he would not have them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:4 王后以斯帖的宫女和太监来把这事告诉以斯帖，她甚是忧愁，就送衣服给末底改穿，要他脱下麻衣，他却不受。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>4:5 Then Esther sent for Hathach, one of the king's unsexed servants whom he had given her for waiting on her, and she gave him orders to go to Mordecai and see what this was and why it was.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:5 以斯帖就把王所派伺候她的一个太监，名叫哈他革召来，吩咐他去见末底改，要知道这是什么事，是什么缘故。

</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:6 于是哈他革出到朝门前的宽阔处见末底改。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>4:7 And Mordecai gave him an account of what had taken place, and of the amount of money which Haman had said he would put into the king's store for the destruction of the Jews.

</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:8 又将所抄写传遍书珊城，要灭绝犹大人的旨意交给哈他革，要给以斯帖看，又要给她说明，并嘱咐她进去见王，为本族的人在王面前恳切祈求。

</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:10 以斯帖就吩咐哈他革去见末底改，说，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>4:11 It is common knowledge among all the king's servants and the people of every part of the kingdom, that if anyone, man or woman, comes to the king in his inner room without being sent for, there is only one law for him, that he is to be put to death; only those to whom the king's rod of gold is stretched out may keep their lives: but I have not been sent for to come before the king these thirty days.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:11 王的一切臣仆和各省的人民，都知道有一个定例，若不蒙召，擅入内院见王的，无论男女必被治死。除非王向他伸出金杖，不得存活。现在我没有蒙召进去见王已经三十日了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>4:12 And they said these words to Mordecai.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:12 人就把以斯帖这话告诉末底改。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>4:13 Then Mordecai sent this answer back to Esther: Do not have the idea that you in the king's house will be safe from the fate of all the Jews.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:13 末底改托人回覆以斯帖说，你莫想在王宫里强过一切犹大人，得免这祸。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>4:14 If at this time you say nothing, then help and salvation will come to the Jews from some other place, but you and your father's family will come to destruction: and who is to say that you have not come to the kingdom even for such a time as this?
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:14 此时你若闭口不言，犹大人必从别处得解脱，蒙拯救，你和你父家，必至灭亡。焉知你得了王后的位分，不是为现今的机会吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>4:15 Then Esther sent them back to Mordecai with this answer:
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:15 以斯帖就吩咐人回报末底改说，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>4:16 Go, get together all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and go without food for me, taking no food or drink night or day for three days: and I and my women will do the same; and so I will go in to the king, which is against the law: and if death is to be my fate, then let it come.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:16 你当去招聚书珊城所有的犹大人，为我禁食三昼三夜，不吃不喝。我和我的宫女也要这样禁食。然后我违例进去见王，我若死就死吧。
