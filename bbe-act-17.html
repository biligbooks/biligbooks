</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:5 但那不信的犹太人心里嫉妒，招聚了些市井匪类，搭伙成群，耸动合城的人，闯进耶孙的家，要将保罗西拉带到百姓那里。

</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:10 弟兄们，随即在夜间打发保罗和西拉往庇哩亚去。二人到了，就进入犹太人的会堂。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>17:11 Now these were more noble than the Jews of Thessalonica, for they gave serious attention to the word, searching in the holy Writings every day, to see if these things were so.

</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:18 还有以彼古罗和斯多亚两门的学士，与他争论。有的说，这胡言乱语的要说什么。有的说，他似乎是传说外邦鬼神的。这话是因保罗传讲耶稣，与复活的道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>17:19 And they took him to Mars' Hill, saying, Will you make clear to us what is this new teaching of yours?

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>17:21 (Now all the Athenians and the men from other lands who come there were giving all their time to talking or hearing of anything new.)

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>17:22 And Paul got to his feet on Mars' Hill and said, O men of Athens, I see that you are overmuch given to fear of the gods.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_22');"> <p>17:23 For when I came by, I was looking at the things to which you give worship, and I saw an altar with this writing on it, TO THE GOD OF WHOM THERE IS NO KNOWLEDGE. Now, what you, without knowledge, give worship to, I make clear to you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_22" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:23 我游行的时候，观看你们所敬拜的，遇见一座坛，上面写着未识之神。你们所不认识而敬拜的，我现在告诉你们。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_23');"> <p>17:24 The God who made the earth and everything in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, is not housed in buildings made with hands;
</p></origin><translate id="div_23" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:24 创造宇宙和其中万物的神，既是天地的主，就不住人手所造的殿。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>17:25 And he is not dependent on the work of men's hands, as if he had need of anything, for he himself gives to all life and breath and all things;
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:25 也不用人手服事，好像缺少什么，自己倒将生命气息，万物，赐给万人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_25');"> <p>17:26 And he has made of one blood all the nations of men living on all the face of the earth, ordering their times and the limits of their lands,
</p></origin><translate id="div_25" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:26 他从一本造出万族的人，（本有古卷作血脉），住在全地上，并且预先定准他们的年限，和所住的疆界。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>17:27 So that they might make search for God, in order, if possible, to get knowledge of him and make discovery of him, though he is not far from every one of us:
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:27 要叫他们寻求神，或者可以揣摩而得，其实他离我们各人不远。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>17:28 For in him we have life and motion and existence; as certain of your verse writers have said, For we are his offspring.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:28 我们生活，动作，存留，都在乎他，就如你们作诗的，有人说，我们也是他所生的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>17:29 If then we are the offspring of God, it is not right for us to have the idea that God is like gold or silver or stone, formed by the art or design of man.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:29 我们既是神所生的，就不当以为神的神性像人用手艺，心思，所雕刻的金，银，石。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>17:30 Those times when men had no knowledge were overlooked by God; but now he gives orders to all men in every place to undergo a change of heart:
</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:30 世人蒙昧无知的时候，神并不监察，如今却吩咐各处的人都要悔改。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>17:31 Because a day has been fixed in which all the world will be judged in righteousness by the man who has been marked out by him for this work; of which he has given a sign to all men by giving him back from the dead.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:31 因为他已经定了日子，要借着他所设立的人，按公义审判天下。并且叫他从死里复活，给万人作可信的凭据。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>17:32 Now on hearing about the coming back from death, some of them made sport of it, but others said, Let us go more fully into this another time.
</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:32 众人听见从死里复活的话，就有讥诮他的，又有人说，我们再听你讲这个吧。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>17:33 And so Paul went away from among them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:33 于是保罗从他们当中出去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>17:34 But some men gave him their support: among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">17:34 但有几个人贴近他，信了主，其中有亚略巴古的官丢尼修，并一个妇人，名叫大马哩，还有别人一同信从。
