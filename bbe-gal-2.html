</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>2:2 And I went up by revelation; and I put before them the good news which I was preaching among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were of good name, so that the work which I was or had been doing might not be without effect.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:2 我是奉启示上去的，把我在外邦人中所传的福音，对弟兄们陈说。却是背地里对那有名望之人说的。惟恐我现在，或是从前，徒然奔跑。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>2:3 But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was made to undergo circumcision:
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:3 但与我同去的提多，虽是希利尼人，也没有勉强他受割礼。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>2:4 And that because of the false brothers let in secretly, who came searching out our free condition which we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might make servants of us;
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:4 因为有偷着引进来的假弟兄，私下窥探我们在基督耶稣里的自由，要叫我们作奴仆。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>2:5 To whom we gave way not even for an hour; so that the true words of the good news might still be with you.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:5 我们就是一刻的工夫，也没有容让顺服他们，为要叫福音的真理仍存在你们中间。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>2:6 But from those who seemed to be important (whatever they were has no weight with me: God does not take man's person into account): those who seemed to be important gave nothing new to me;
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:6 至于那些有名望的，不论他是何等人，都与我无干。神不以外貌取人。那些有名望的，并没有加增我什么。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>2:7 But, quite the opposite, when they saw that I had been made responsible for preaching the good news to those without circumcision, even as Peter had been for those of the circumcision
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:7 反倒看见了主托我传福音给那未受割礼的人，正如托彼得传福音给那受割礼的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>2:8 (Because he who was working in Peter as the Apostle of the circumcision was working no less in me among the Gentiles);
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:8 （那感动彼得，叫他为受割礼之人作使徒的，也感动我，叫我为外邦人作使徒）
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>2:9 When they saw the grace which was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who had the name of being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas their right hands as friends so that we might go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision;
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:9 又知道所赐给我的恩典，那称为教会柱石的雅各，矶法，约翰，就向我和巴拿巴用右手行相交之礼，叫我们往外邦人那里去，他们往受割礼的人那里去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>2:10 Only it was their desire that we would give thought to the poor; which very thing I had much in mind to do.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:10 只是愿意我们记念穷人。这也是我本来热心去行的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>2:11 But when Cephas came to Antioch, I made a protest against him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:11 后来矶法到了安提阿，因他有可责之处，我就当面抵挡他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>2:12 For before certain men came from James, he did take food with the Gentiles: but when they came, he went back and made himself separate, fearing those who were of the circumcision.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:12 从雅各那里来的人，未到以先，他和外邦人一同吃饭。及至他们来到，他因怕奉割礼的人，就退去与外邦人隔开了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>2:13 And the rest of the Jews went after him, so that even Barnabas was overcome by their false ways.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:13 其余的犹太人，也都随着他装假。甚至连巴拿巴也随伙装假。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>2:14 But when I saw that they were not living uprightly in agreement with the true words of the good news, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, being a Jew, are living like the Gentiles, and not like the Jews, how will you make the Gentiles do the same as the Jews?
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:14 但我一看见他们行得不正，与福音的真理不合，就在众人面前对矶法说，你既是犹太人，若随外邦人行事，不随犹太人行事，怎么还勉强外邦人随犹太人呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>2:15 We being Jews by birth, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:15 我们这生来的犹太人，不是外邦的罪人，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>2:16 Being conscious that a man does not get righteousness by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we had faith in Christ Jesus, so that we might get righteousness by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law will no flesh get righteousness.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:16 既知道人称义，不是因行律法，乃是因信耶稣基督，连我们也信了基督耶稣，使我们因信基督称义，不因行律法称义，因为凡有血气的，没有一人因行律法称义。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_16');"> <p>2:17 But if, while we were desiring to get righteousness through Christ, we ourselves were seen to be sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? In no way!
</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:17 我们若求在基督里称义，却仍旧是罪人，难道基督是叫人犯罪的吗？断乎不是。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_17');"> <p>2:18 For if I put up again those things which I gave to destruction, I am seen to be a wrongdoer.
</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:18 我素来所拆毁的，若重新建造，这就证明自己是犯罪的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_18');"> <p>2:19 For I, through the law, have become dead to the law, so that I might be living to God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_18" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:19 我因律法就向律法死了，叫我可以向神活着。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_19');"> <p>2:20 I have been put to death on the cross with Christ; still I am living; no longer I, but Christ is living in me; and that life which I now am living in the flesh I am living by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who in love for me, gave himself up for me.
</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:20 我已经与基督同钉十字架。现在活着的，不再是我，乃是基督在我里面活着。并且我如今在肉身活着，是因信神的儿子而活，他是爱我，为我舍己。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>2:21 I do not make the grace of God of no effect: because if righteousness is through the law, then Christ was put to death for nothing.
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:21 我不废掉神的恩。义若是借着律法得的，基督就是徒然死了。
