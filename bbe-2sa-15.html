</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">15:2 押沙龙常常早晨起来，站在城门的道旁，凡有争讼要去求王判断的，押沙龙就叫他过来，问他说，你是哪一城的人。回答说，仆人是以色列某支派的人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>15:3 And Absalom would say to him, See, your cause is true and right; but no man has been named by the king to give you a hearing.
