</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>21:25 But as to the Gentiles who have the faith, we sent a letter, giving our decision that they were to keep themselves from offerings made to false gods, and from blood, and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law, and from the evil desires of the body.
</p></origin><translate id="div_24" onclick="disDiv(this);">21:25 至于信主的外邦人，我们已经写信拟定，叫他们谨忌那祭偶像之物，和血，并勒死的牲畜，与奸淫。

</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">21:28 喊叫说，以色列人来帮助，这就是在各处教训众人糟践我们百姓，和律法，并这地方的。他又带着希利尼人进殿，污秽了这圣地。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_28');"> <p>21:29 For they had seen him before in the town with Trophimus of Ephesus, and had the idea that Paul had taken him with him into the Temple.
</p></origin><translate id="div_28" onclick="disDiv(this);">21:29 这话是因他们曾看见以弗所人特罗非摩，同保罗在城里，以为保罗带他进了殿。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_29');"> <p>21:30 And all the town was moved, and the people came running together and put their hands on Paul, pulling him out of the Temple: and then the doors were shut.

</p></origin><translate id="div_31" onclick="disDiv(this);">21:32 千夫长立时带着兵丁，和几个百夫长，跑下去到他们那里。他们见了千夫长和兵丁，就止住不打保罗。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>21:33 Then the chief captain came near and took him, and gave orders for him to be put in chains, questioning them as to who he was and what he had done.
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">21:33 于是千夫长上前拿住他，吩咐用两条铁链捆锁。又问他是什么人，作的是什么事。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>21:34 And some said one thing and some another, among the people: and as he was not able to get a knowledge of the facts because of the noise, he gave orders for Paul to be taken into the army building.
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">21:34 众人有喊叫这个的，有喊叫那个的。千夫长因为这样乱嚷，得不着实情，就吩咐人将保罗带进营楼去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"> <p>21:35 And when he came on to the steps, he was lifted up by the armed men, because of the force of the people;
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);">21:35 到了台阶上，众人挤得凶猛，兵丁只得将保罗抬起来。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>21:36 For a great mass of people came after them, crying out, Away with him!
</p></origin><translate id="div_35" onclick="disDiv(this);">21:36 众人跟在后面，喊着说，除掉他。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"> <p>21:37 And when Paul was about to be taken into the building, he said to the chief captain, May I say something to you? And he said, Have you a knowledge of Greek?
</p></origin><translate id="div_36" onclick="disDiv(this);">21:37 将要带他进营楼，保罗对千夫长说，我对你说句话，可以不可以？他说，你懂得希利尼话吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_37');"> <p>21:38 Are you by chance the Egyptian who, before this, got the people worked up against the government and took four thousand men of the Assassins out into the waste land?
</p></origin><translate id="div_37" onclick="disDiv(this);">21:38 你莫非是从前作乱，带领四千凶徒，往旷野去的那埃及人吗？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_38');"> <p>21:39 But Paul said, I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, which is not an unimportant town: I make a request to you to let me say a word to the people.
</p></origin><translate id="div_38" onclick="disDiv(this);">21:39 保罗说，我本是犹太人，生在基利家的大数，并不是无名小城的人，求你准我对百姓说话。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_39');"> <p>21:40 And when he let him do so, Paul, from the steps, made a sign with his hand to the people, and when they were all quiet, he said to them in the Hebrew language,
</p></origin><translate id="div_39" onclick="disDiv(this);">21:40 千夫长准了，保罗就站在台阶上，向百姓摆手，他们都静默无声，保罗便用希伯来话对他们说。
