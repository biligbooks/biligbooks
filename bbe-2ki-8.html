</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">8:5 基哈西告诉王以利沙如何使死人复活，恰巧以利沙所救活，她儿子的那妇人为自己的房屋田地来哀告王。基哈西说，我主我王，这就是那妇人，这是她的儿子，就是以利沙所救活的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>8:6 And in answer to the king's questions, the woman gave him all the story. So the king gave orders to one of his unsexed servants, saying, Give her back all her property, and all the produce of her fields from the day when she went away from the land up till now.
