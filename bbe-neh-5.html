</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>5:8 And I said to them, We have given whatever we were able to give, to make our brothers the Jews free, who were servants and prisoners of the nations: and would you now give up your brothers for a price, and are they to become our property? Then they said nothing, answering not a word.

</p></origin><translate id="div_17" onclick="disDiv(this);">5:18 每日预备一只公牛，六只肥羊，又预备些飞禽。每十日一次，多预备各样的酒。虽然如此，我并不要省长的俸禄，因为百姓服役甚重。
