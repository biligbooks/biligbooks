</p></origin><translate id="div_0" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:1 我们既蒙留下有进入他安息的应许，就当畏惧，免得我们中间，（我们原文作你们）或有人似乎是赶不上了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_1');"> <p>4:2 And, truly, the good news came to us, even as it did to them; but the hearing of the word did them no good, because they were not united in faith with the true hearers.
</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:2 因为有福音传给我们，像传给他们一样。只是所听见的道与他们无益，因为他们没有信心与所听见的道调和。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_2');"> <p>4:3 For those of us who have belief come into his rest; even as he has said, As I said in my oath when I was angry, They may not come into my rest: though the works were done from the time of the making of the world.
</p></origin><translate id="div_2" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:3 但我们已经相信的人，得以进入那安息，正如神所说，我在怒中起誓说，他们断不可进入我的安息。其实造物之工，从创世以来已经成全了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>4:4 For in one place he has said of the seventh day, And God had rest from all his works on the seventh day;
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:4 论到第七日，有一处说，到第七日神就歇了他一切的工。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>4:5 And in the same place he says again, They will not come into my rest.
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:5 又有一处说，他们断不可进入我的安息。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>4:6 So that as it is clear that some have to go in, and that the first hearers of the good news were not able to go in because they went against God's orders,
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:6 既有必进安息的人，那先前听见福音的，因为不信从，不得进去。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>4:7 After a long time, again naming a certain day, he says in David, Today (as he had said before), Today if you will let his voice come to your ears, be not hard of heart,
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:7 所以过了多年，就在大卫的书上，又限定一日，如以上所引的说，你们今日若听他的话，就不可硬着心。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>4:8 For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have said anything about another day.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:8 若是约书亚已叫他们享了安息，后来神就不再提别的日子了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>4:9 So that there is still a Sabbath-keeping for the people of God.
</p></origin><translate id="div_8" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:9 这样看来，必另有一安息日的安息，为神的子民存留。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_9');"> <p>4:10 For the man who comes into his rest has had rest from his works, as God did from his.
</p></origin><translate id="div_9" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:10 因为那进入安息的，乃是歇了自己的工，正如神歇了他的工一样。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_10');"> <p>4:11 Because of this, let us have a strong desire to come into that rest, and let no one go after the example of those who went against God's orders.
</p></origin><translate id="div_10" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:11 所以我们务必竭力进入那安息，免得有人学那不信从的样子跌倒了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_11');"> <p>4:12 For the word of God is living and full of power, and is sharper than any two-edged sword, cutting through and making a division even of the soul and the spirit, the bones and the muscles, and quick to see the thoughts and purposes of the heart.
</p></origin><translate id="div_11" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:12 神的道是活泼的，是有功效的，比一切两刃的剑更快，甚至魂与灵，骨节与骨髓，都能刺入剖开，连心中的思念和主意，都能辨明。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_12');"> <p>4:13 And there is nothing made which is not completely clear to him; there is nothing covered, but all things are open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
</p></origin><translate id="div_12" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:13 并且被造的，没有一样在他面前不显然的。原来万物，在那与我们有关系的主眼前，都是赤露敞开的。

</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:14 我们既然有一位已经升入高天尊荣的大祭司，就是神的儿子耶稣，便当持定所承认的道。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>4:15 For we have not a high priest who is not able to be touched by the feelings of our feeble flesh; but we have one who has been tested in all points as we ourselves are tested, but without sin.
</p></origin><translate id="div_14" onclick="disDiv(this);">4:15 因我们的大祭司，并非不能体恤我们的软弱。他也曾凡事受过试探，与我们一样。只是他没有犯罪。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>4:16 Then let us come near to the seat of grace without fear, so that mercy may be given to us, and we may get grace for our help in time of need.
