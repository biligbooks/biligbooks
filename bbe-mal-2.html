</p></origin><translate id="div_1" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:2 万军之耶和华说，你们若不听从，也不放在心上，将荣耀归与我的名，我就使咒诅临到你们，使你们的福分变为咒诅。因你们不把诫命放在心上，我已经咒诅你们了。

</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:4 你们就知道我传这诫命给你们，使我与利未（或作利未人）所立的约，可以常存。这是万军之耶和华说的。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>2:5 My agreement with him was on my side life and peace, and I gave them to him; on his side fear, and he had fear of me and gave honour to my name.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_13');"> <p>2:14 But you say, For what reason? Because the Lord has been a witness between you and the wife of your early years, to whom you have been untrue, though she is your friend and the wife to whom you have given your word.
</p></origin><translate id="div_13" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:14 你们还说，这是为什么呢？因耶和华在你和你幼年所娶的妻中间作见证。她虽是你的配偶，又是你盟约的妻，你却以诡诈待她。

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_15');"> <p>2:16 For I am against the putting away of a wife, says the Lord, the God of Israel, and against him who is clothed with violent acts, says the Lord of armies: so give thought to your spirit and do not be false in your acts.
</p></origin><translate id="div_15" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:16 耶和华以色列的神说，休妻的事，和以强暴待妻的人，都是我所恨恶的。所以当谨守你们的心，不可行诡诈。这是万军之耶和华说的。

</p></origin><translate id="div_16" onclick="disDiv(this);">2:17 你们用言语烦琐耶和华，你们还说，我们在何事上烦琐他呢？因为你们说，凡行恶的，耶和华眼看为善，并且他喜悦他们。或说，公义的神在哪里呢？
