</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_3');"> <p>7:4 And when they come from the market-place, they take no food till their hands are washed; and a number of other orders there are, which have been handed down to them to keep--washings of cups and pots and brass vessels.
</p></origin><translate id="div_3" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:4 从市上来，若不洗浴，也不吃饭，还有好些别的规矩，他们历代拘守，就是洗杯，罐，铜器，等物）。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_4');"> <p>7:5 And the Pharisees and the scribes put the question to him, Why do your disciples not keep the rules of the fathers, but take their bread with unwashed hands?
</p></origin><translate id="div_4" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:5 法利赛人和文士问他说，你的门徒为什么不照古人的遗传，用俗手吃饭呢？
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_5');"> <p>7:6 And he said, Well did Isaiah say of you, you false ones: These people give me honour with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
</p></origin><translate id="div_5" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:6 耶稣说，以赛亚指着你们假冒为善之人所说的预言，是不错的，如经上说，这百姓用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_6');"> <p>7:7 But their worship is to no purpose, while they give as their teaching the rules of men.
</p></origin><translate id="div_6" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:7 他们将人的吩咐，当作道理教导人，所以拜我也是枉然。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_7');"> <p>7:8 For, turning away from the law of God, you keep the rules of men.
</p></origin><translate id="div_7" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:8 你们是离弃神的诫命，拘守人的遗传。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_8');"> <p>7:9 And he said to them, Truly you put on one side the law of God, so that you may keep the rules which have been handed down to you.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_14');"> <p>7:15 There is nothing outside the man which, going into him, is able to make him unclean: but the things which come out of the man are those which make the man unclean.

</p></origin><translate id="div_19" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:20 又说，从人里面出来的，那才能污秽人。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_20');"> <p>7:21 Because from inside, from the heart of men, come evil thoughts and unclean pleasures,
</p></origin><translate id="div_20" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:21 因为从里面，就是从人心里，发出恶念，苟合，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_21');"> <p>7:22 The taking of goods and of life, broken faith between husband and wife, the desire of wealth, wrongdoing, deceit, sins of the flesh, an evil eye, angry words, pride, foolish acts:

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_24');"> <p>7:25 But a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having had news of him, came straight away and went down at his feet.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_26');"> <p>7:27 And he said to her, Let the children first have their food: for it is not right to take the children's bread and give it to the dogs.
</p></origin><translate id="div_26" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:27 耶稣对她说，让儿女们先吃饱。不好拿儿女的饼丢给狗吃。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_27');"> <p>7:28 But she said to him in answer, Yes, Lord: even the dogs under the table take the bits dropped by the children.
</p></origin><translate id="div_27" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:28 妇人回答说，主阿，不错。但是狗在桌子底下，也吃孩子们的碎渣儿。

</p></origin><translate id="div_29" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:30 她就回家去，见小孩子躺在床上，鬼已经出去了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_30');"> <p>7:31 And again he went out from Tyre, and came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the country of Decapolis.
</p></origin><translate id="div_30" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:31 耶稣又离了推罗的境界，经过西顿，就从低加波利境内来到加利利海。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_31');"> <p>7:32 And they came to him with one who had no power of hearing and had trouble in talking; and they made a request to him to put his hands on him.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_32');"> <p>7:33 And he took him on one side from the people privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he put water from his mouth on the man's tongue with his finger;
</p></origin><translate id="div_32" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:33 耶稣领他离开众人，到一边去，就用指头探他的耳朵，吐唾沫抹他的舌头，
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_33');"> <p>7:34 And looking up to heaven, he took a deep breath, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be open.
</p></origin><translate id="div_33" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:34 望天叹息，对他说，以法大，就是说，开了吧。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_34');"> <p>7:35 And his ears became open, and the band of his tongue was made loose, and his words became clear.
</p></origin><translate id="div_34" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:35 他的耳朵就开了，舌结也解了，说话也清楚了。
</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_35');"> <p>7:36 And he gave them orders not to give news of it to anyone; but the more he made this request, so much the more they made it public.

</p></translate><origin onclick="showDiv('div_36');"> <p>7:37 And they were overcome with wonder, saying, He has done all things well: he even gives back the power of hearing and the power of talking to those who have been without them.
</p></origin><translate id="div_36" onclick="disDiv(this);">7:37 众人分外希奇，说，他所作的事都好，他连聋子也叫他们听见，哑吧也叫他们说话。
